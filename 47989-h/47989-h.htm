<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>A MYSTERIOUS TELEGRAM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Goodbye, Judy! Goodbye, Irene! Don’t
like New York so well that you won’t want to
come home!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t keep them too long, Pauline! Farringdon
will be as dead as so many bricks without
them. Even the cats will miss Blackberry.
Make him wave his paw, Judy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t forget to write!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Goodbye, Pauline! Goodbye, Judy! Goodbye,
Irene!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Goodbye! Goodbye!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Peter’s car was off, bearing the last load
of campers back to their home town.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>Judy Bolton watched them out of sight.
They were taking the familiar road, but she and
Irene Lang would soon be traveling in the other
direction. Pauline Faulkner had invited them
for a visit, including Judy’s cat in the invitation,
and they were going back with her to New
York.</p>

<p class='c005'>A long blue bus hove into view, and all three
girls hailed it, at first expectantly, then frantically
when they saw it was not stopping. It
slowed down a few feet ahead of them, but
when they attempted to board it the driver
eyed Blackberry with disapproval.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can’t take the cat unless he’s in a crate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s good,” Judy began. “He won’t be
any trouble——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can’t help it. Company’s rules.” And he
was about to close the door when Judy’s quick
idea saved the situation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, he’s <i>in a crate</i>,” she declared
with vigor as she thrust the cat inside her own
pretty hatbox. The hats she hastily removed
and bundled under one arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>The driver had to give in. He even grinned
a bit sheepishly as the girls took their seats,
Pauline and Irene together, “Because,” Judy
insisted as she took the seat just behind them,
“I have Blackberry.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>The other passengers on the bus were regarding
the newcomers with amused interest.
A ten-year-old boy brought forth a ball of twine
and rolled it playfully in Blackberry’s direction.
An old lady made purring noises through
her lips. Everyone seemed to be nodding and
smiling. Everyone except the serious young
man across the aisle. He never turned his
head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy nudged the two friends in the seat
ahead of her and confided a desire to do something—anything
to make him look up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Judy,” Irene replied, shocked. “I’ve
been watching that man myself and he’s—he’s——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Almost my ideal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Silly!” Judy laughed. “I’d like to bet he
wouldn’t be so ideal if I did something to disturb
those precious papers that he’s reading.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare you!” Pauline said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sixteen or not, the dare tempted Judy. It
was an easy matter to let Blackberry out of the
hatbox in her arms and down into the aisle.
The cat’s plumelike tail did the rest.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>The man looked up. But, to Judy’s surprise,
he looked up with a smile. Irene, all contrition,
hastened to apologize.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No harm done,” he returned good-naturedly
and began collecting his scattered papers.
Soon he had them rearranged and resumed his
reading. There were a great many typewritten
sheets of paper, and he seemed to be reading
critically, scratching out something here and
adding something there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were wrong,” Irene said, turning to
Judy. “See how nice he was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should have known better than to dare a
girl like you,” Pauline put in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was horrid of me,” Judy admitted, now
almost as interested as Irene in the strange
young man. Not because he was Judy’s ideal—a
man who wouldn’t notice a cat until its tail
bumped into him—but because the papers on
his lap might be important. And she had disturbed
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man, apparently unaware that the accident
had been anybody’s fault, continued reading
and correcting. Judy watched her cat carefully
until the stack of papers was safely inside
his portfolio again.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>“That’s finished,” he announced as though
speaking to himself. He screwed the top on his
fountain pen, placed it in his pocket and then
turned to the girls. “Nice scenery, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was,” Judy replied, laughing, “but you
didn’t seem to be paying much attention to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve been over this road a great many
times,” he explained, “and one does tire of
scenery, like anything else. Passengers in the
bus are different.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean different from scenery?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and from each other. For instance,
you with your ridiculous cat and your golden-haired
friend who apologized for you and that
small, dark girl are three distinct types.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy regarded him curiously. She had never
thought of herself or either of the other girls as
“types.” Now she tried to analyze his
meaning.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their lives had certainly been different.
Judy and Pauline, although of independent
natures, had always felt the security of dependence
upon their parents while Irene’s crippled
father depended solely upon her. This responsibility
made her seem older than her years—older
and younger, too. She never could
acquire Pauline’s poise or Judy’s fearlessness.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>In appearance, too, they were different. Her
first vacation had done wonders for Irene
Lang. Now her usually pale cheeks glowed
with healthy color, and her eyes were a deeper,
happier blue. Two weeks of sunshine had
tanned her skin and brought out all the gold in
her hair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline, too, had acquired a becoming tan
which made her hair look darker than ever and
contrasted strangely with her keen, light blue
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sun had not been quite so kind to Judy.
It had discovered a few faint freckles on her
nose and given her hair a decided reddish cast.
But Judy didn’t mind. Camp life had been exciting—boating,
swimming and, as a climax, a
thrilling ride in Arthur Farringdon-Pett’s new
airplane.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man beside Judy was a little like
Arthur in appearance—tall, good-looking but
altogether too grown-up and serious. Judy
liked boys to make jokes now and then, even
tease the way her brother, Horace, did. Peter
teased her, too.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Queer,” she thought, “to miss being
teased.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>This stranger seemed to like serious-minded
people and presently changed the conversation
to books and music, always favorite topics with
Irene. Then Judy spoke about the work that he
was doing but learned nothing except that
“finished” in his case meant that he had succeeded
in putting his papers back in their
original sequence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if you girls were all of the same type,”
he added, “I doubt if I would have forgiven
you your prank.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess he doesn’t care for my type,” Judy
whispered to the other two girls a little later.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mine either,” Pauline returned with a
laugh. “At least he wouldn’t if he knew I
dared you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you suppose,” Irene asked naïvely,
“that he cares for my type?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked very pathetic as she said that, and
Judy, remembering Irene’s misfortunes, slid
into the seat beside her and put a loving arm
about her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I care for your type,” she said. “So why
worry about what a stranger thinks?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>“I’m not,” Irene said, belying her answer
with a wistful look in the stranger’s direction.
He was still absorbed in the mountain of typewritten
pages that he held on his knee. It
seemed that his work, whatever it was, engrossed
him completely. He was again making
corrections and additions with his pen. Judy
noticed a yellow slip of paper on the seat beside
him and called the other girls’ attention
to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It looks like a telegram,” she whispered,
“and he keeps referring to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Telegrams are usually bad news,” Irene replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man sat a little distance away
from them and, to all appearances, had forgotten
their existence. Girl-like, they discussed
him, imagining him as everything from a politician
to a cub reporter, finally deciding that,
since he lived in Greenwich Village, he must be
an artist. Irene said she liked to think of him
as talented. A dreamer, she would have called
him, if it had not been for his practical interest
in the business at hand—those papers and that
telegram.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was dark by the time they reached New
York. The passengers were restless and eager
to be out of the bus. The young man hastily
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>crammed his typewritten work into his portfolio
and Judy noticed, just as the bus stopped,
that he had forgotten the telegram. She and
Irene both made a dive for it with the unfortunate
result that when they stood up again
each of them held a torn half of the yellow slip.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just our luck!” exclaimed Irene. “Now
we can’t return it to him. Anyway, he’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We could piece it together,” Pauline suggested,
promptly suiting her actions to her
words. When the two jagged edges were fitted
against each other, this is what the astonished
girls read:</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c015'>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Irene was the first to finish reading.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good heavens! What would <i>he</i> know about
robbery and murder?” she exclaimed, staring
first at the telegram in Pauline’s hand and
then at the empty seat across the aisle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, nothing that I can think of. He didn’t
seem like a crook. The telegram may be in
code,” Pauline mused as she handed the torn
pieces to Judy. “I like his name—Dale Meredith.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>“So do I. But Emily Grimshaw——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All out! Last stop!” the bus driver was
calling. “Take care of that cat,” he said with
a chuckle as he helped the girls with their suitcases.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were still wondering about the strange
telegram as they made their way through the
crowd on Thirty-fourth Street.</p>

  <h2 id='chap02' class='c013'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>IRENE’S DISCOVERY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A taxi soon brought the girls to the door of
Dr. Faulkner’s nineteenth century stone house.
The stoop had been torn down and replaced by
a modern entrance hall, but the high ceilings
and winding stairways were as impressive as
ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>Drinking in the fascination of it, Judy and
Irene followed the man, Oliver, who carried
their bags right up to the third floor where
Pauline had a sitting room and a smaller bedroom
all to herself. The former was furnished
with a desk, sofa, easy chairs, numerous shaded
lamps, a piano and a radio.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here the man left them with a curt, “’Ere
you are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And it’s good to have you, my dears,” the
more sociable housekeeper welcomed them.
Soon she was bustling around the room setting
their bags in order. She offered to help unpack.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>“Never mind that now, Mary,” Pauline told
her. “We’re dead tired and I can lend them
some of my things for tonight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I’ll fix up the double bed in the next
room for your guests and leave you to yourselves,”
the kind old lady said.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as she had closed the door Judy
lifted her cat out of the hatbox. With a grateful
noise, halfway between a purr and a yowl,
Blackberry leaped to the floor and began, at
once, to explore the rooms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“His padded feet were made for soft carpets,”
Judy said fondly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you suppose he’d like gravel?”
Pauline asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, he’d love it!” Judy exclaimed. “You
know our cellar floor is covered with gravel,
and he sleeps down there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is this gravel in the cellar?” Irene asked,
beginning to get an attack of shivers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline laughed. “Goodness, no! It’s on
the roof garden.” She walked across the room
and flung open a door. “Nothing shivery about
that, is there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing except the thought of standing on
the top of one of those tall buildings,” Irene
said, gazing upward as she followed Pauline.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>The view fascinated Judy. Looking out
across lower New York, she found a new world
of gray buildings and flickering lights. In the
other direction the Empire State Building
loomed like a sentinel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never dreamed New York was like this,”
she breathed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It grows on a person,” Pauline declared.
“I would never want to live in any other city.
No matter how bored or how annoyed I may be
during the day, at night I can always come up
here and feel the thrill of having all this for a
home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish I had a home I could feel that way
about,” Irene sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The garden was too alluring for the girls to
want to leave it. Even Blackberry had settled
himself in a bed of geraniums. These and other
plants in enormous boxes bordered the complete
inclosure. Inside were wicker chairs, a table
and a hammock hung between two posts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is where I do all my studying,” Pauline
said, “and you two girls may come up here
and read if you like while I’m at school.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>“At school?” Judy repeated, dazed until she
thought of something that she should have considered
before accepting Pauline’s invitation.
Of course Pauline would be in school. She
hadn’t been given a holiday as the girls in Farringdon
had when their school burned down.
Judy and Irene would be left to entertain themselves
all day unless Dr. Faulkner had some
plans for them. Judy wondered where he was.</p>

<p class='c005'>After they had gone inside again, that is, all
of them except Blackberry who seemed to have
adopted the roof garden as a permanent home,
she became curious enough to ask.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” Pauline said in surprise.
“Father is away. A medical conference
in Europe. He’s always going somewhere like
that, but he’ll be home in two or three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we’ll be alone for three weeks?” Irene
asked, dismayed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” Pauline returned indifferently.
“There’s nothing to be afraid of with servants
in the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Irene was not used to servants. Ever
since her father became disabled she had waited
on herself and kept their shabby little house in
apple-pie order. The house was closed now and
their few good pieces of furniture put in storage.
All summer long there would not be any
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>rent problems or any cooking. Then, when fall
came, she and her father would find a new
home. Where it would be or how they would
pay for it worried Irene when she thought
about it. She tried not to think because Dr.
Bolton had told her she needed a rest. Her
father, a patient of the doctor’s, was undergoing
treatments at the Farringdon Sanitarium.
The treatments were being given
according to Dr. Bolton’s directions but not by
him as Judy’s home, too, was closed for the
summer. Her parents had not intended to stay
away more than a week or two, but influenza
had swept the town where they were visiting.
Naturally, the doctor stayed and his wife with
him. Judy’s brother, a reporter and student
of journalism, had gone to live in the college
dormitory.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it was that both girls knew they could
not return to Farringdon no matter how homesick
they might be. They had the cat for comfort
and they had each other. Ever since Irene
had come to work in Dr. Bolton’s office these
two had been like sisters. Lois, Lorraine,
Betty, Marge, Pauline—all of them were
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>friends. But Irene and Honey, the other girl
who had shared Judy’s home, were closer than
that. Judy felt with them. She felt with Irene
the longing of the other girl for something to
hold fast to—a substantial home that could not
be taken away at every whim of the landlord,
just enough money so that she could afford to
look her best and the security of some strong
person to depend upon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will your school last long?” Irene was asking
the dark-haired girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not long enough,” Pauline sighed, revealing
the fact that she too had troubles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you’ll be free?” Irene went on, unmindful
of the sigh. “We can go places together?
You’ll have time to show us around.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline shrugged her shoulders. “Don’t
talk about time to me. Time will be my middle
name after I graduate. There isn’t a single
thing I really want to do, least of all stay at
home all day. College is a bore unless you’re
planning a career. What do you intend to do
when you’re through school?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>“I hadn’t planned,” Irene said, “except that
I want time to read and go ahead with my
music. Of course I’ll keep house somewhere
for Dad. It will be so nice to have him well
again, and I love keeping house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about your work for my father?”
Judy asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene’s eyes became troubled. “He doesn’t
really need me any more. I know now, Judy,
that you just made that position for me. It was
lovely of you, but I—I’d just as soon not go
back where I’m not needed. Your father trusts
too many people ever to get rich and he could
use that money he’s been paying me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t feel that way about it,” Judy begged.</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene’s feelings, however, could not easily be
changed, and with both girls having such grave
worries the problem bid fair to be too great a
one for even Judy to solve. Solving problems,
she hoped, would eventually be her career for
she planned to become a regular detective with
a star under her coat. Now she confided this
ambition to the other two girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A detective!” Pauline gasped. “Why,
Judy, only men are detectives. Can you imagine
anyone taking a mere girl on the police
force?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>“Chief Kelly, back home, would take her this
very minute if she applied,” Irene declared.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline nodded, easily convinced. This practical,
black-haired, blue-eyed girl had helped
Judy solve two mysteries and knew that she had
talent. But Pauline didn’t want to meet crooks.
She didn’t want to be bothered with sick or
feeble-minded people and often felt thankful
that her father, a brain specialist, had his offices
elsewhere. Pauline wanted to meet cultured
people who were also interesting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“People, like that man we met on the bus,”
she said, “who read and can discuss books intelligently.
I’d hate to think of his being mixed
up in anything crooked.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can’t <i>make</i> me believe that he was,”
Irene put in with a vigor quite rare for her.
“Couldn’t you just see in his eyes that he was
real?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t look in his eyes,” Judy returned
with a laugh, “but you can be sure I’ll never
be satisfied until we find out what that mysterious
telegram meant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the days that followed Judy learned that
the mere mention of the stranger’s name, Dale
Meredith, would cause either girl to cease
worrying about a home or about a career, as
the case might be.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>“It’s almost magical,” she said to herself
and had to admit that the spell was also upon
her. Perhaps a dozen times a day she would
puzzle over the torn papers in her pocketbook.
But then, it was Judy’s nature to puzzle over
things. It was for that reason that she usually
chose detective stories whenever she sat down
with a book. That hammock up there on the
roof garden was an invitation to read, and soon
Judy and Irene had finished all the suitable
stories in Dr. Faulkner’s library. They had
seen a few shows, gazed at a great many tall
buildings, and found New York, generally, less
thrilling from the street than it had been from
the roof garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline sensed this and worried about entertaining
her guests. “How would you like to
go and see Grant’s Tomb today?” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For Heaven’s sake, think of something a
little more exciting than that,” Judy exclaimed
thoughtlessly. “I’d rather find a library somewhere
and then lie and read something in the
hammock.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>“So would I,” agreed Irene, relieved that
Judy hadn’t wanted to see the tomb.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, if a library’s all you want,” Pauline
said, “why not walk along with me and I’ll
show you one on my way to school.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A big one?” Judy asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, just a small one. In fact, it’s only a
bookshop with a circulating library for its customers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy sighed. It would seem nice to see something
small for a change. She never recognized
this library at all until they were almost inside
the door. Then her eyes shone.</p>

<p class='c005'>What an interesting place it was! On the
counters were quaint gifts and novelties as well
as books. The salesladies all wore smocks, like
artists, and had the courtesy to leave the girls
alone. Pauline had to hurry on to school but
left Judy and Irene to browse. Before long
they had discovered a sign reading MYSTERY
AND ADVENTURE. That was what Judy
liked. Rows and rows of new books, like soldiers,
marched along the shelves.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a lot of flying stories,” Irene said,
absently removing one of them from its place.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>“And murder mysteries,” Judy added. “It’s
always a temptation to read them. <i>Murders in
Castle Stein</i>....”</p>

<p class='c005'>She started back as her eye caught the
author’s name.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Dale Meredith!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>A DARING SCHEME</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Thrilled by her discovery, Judy removed
the torn pieces of telegram from her purse
and began unraveling the mystery, bit by bit.
Irene looked on, trembling with excitement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘CUT ART SHOP ROBBERY STOP
FIFTY THOUSAND IS PLENTY STOP....’
<i>Art Shop Robbery!</i> That sounds like a title!
And someone wanted him to cut it to fifty
thousand words—just a nice length for a book.
That must have been what he was doing on the
bus, cutting down the number of words on those
typewritten pages.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, of course,” Irene agreed. “I always
knew you were gifted, Judy, but can you explain
this?” She pointed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘ONE MAN MURDERED INTERESTS
RANDALL....’ Easy as pie! Another title
and a publisher.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy tossed her head with a self-satisfied
air of importance. Every one of their questions
might be answered in the classified directory.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>They found a telephone booth near by and a
directory on the shelf beside it. Promptly turning
to the list of publishing houses, Judy’s
finger traveled down one complete page and
half of another, but no Randall could she find.
With a sigh of disappointment she turned to
look again at the telegram:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“DISCUSS TERMS MONDAY”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“EMILY GRIMSHAW”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>What sort of person was she? A relative?
No. Relatives didn’t discuss terms with authors.
Wives and sweethearts didn’t either.
They might discuss his books, but not terms.
Anyway Irene hoped that Dale Meredith had
no wife or sweetheart, certainly not a sweetheart
with a name like Emily Grimshaw. That
name sounded as harsh to the ears as Dale
Meredith sounded musical.</p>

<p class='c005'>Flipping the pages of the directory, Judy
came upon the answer to their question:</p>

<p class='c005'>“AUTHOR’S AGENTS (<i>See</i> Literary
Agents).”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That might be it!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>She turned to the place and, beginning at the
top of the page, both girls searched eagerly
through the G’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Greenspan, Grier, Grimshaw....”</p>

<p class='c005'>The name was Emily and the address was
a number on Madison Square. Irene was so
excited that she declared she could feel her
heart thumping under her slip-on sweater.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d give anything to meet him again, Judy!
Anything!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And suddenly Judy wanted to meet him too,
not for her own sake but for Irene’s. A bold
plan began to take shape in her mind. If she
and Irene found positions in Emily Grimshaw’s
office Dale Meredith would never know that it
had not been a simple coincidence. It would be
such fun—this scheming. It would give them
something to do and if Judy’s plan worked it
might even solve the problem of Pauline’s
career.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course Emily Grimshaw may not hire
us,” Judy said after she had outlined the
scheme and won Irene’s approval. “But, at
any rate, it’s worth trying. We won’t need to
tell her it’s only for a few weeks when Pauline
will be there to step right into the position.
I wonder how you get to Madison Square.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>She stopped a policeman to ask him and
found it to be within easy walking distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We might as well go now,” Irene agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps if they thought about it too long
they might lose heart and not attempt it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The literary agent’s office was located in an
old hotel on the northeast side of the square.
The building looked as if it had been unchanged
for a century. In the lobby Judy and Irene
paused, surveying the quaint furniture and
mural decorations before they mustered enough
courage to inquire at the desk for Emily Grimshaw.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s calling?” the clerk asked tartly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell her—” Judy hesitated. “Tell her it’s
two girls to see her on business.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The message was relayed over the switchboard
and presently the clerk turned and said,
“She will see one of you. First stairway to
the left. Fourth floor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only one—” Judy began.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She always sees one client at a time. The
other girl can wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s right. I—I’ll wait,” Irene stammered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you wanted the position——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>“I don’t now. Suppose she asked about experience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ve had a little. You stand a better
chance than I do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not with your nerve, Judy,” Irene said.
“This place gives me the shivers. You’re welcome
to go exploring dark halls if you like. I’d
rather sit here in the lobby and read Dale Meredith’s
book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, so that’s it? Make yourself comfortable,”
Judy advised with a laugh. “I may be
gone a long, long time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not if she finds out how old you are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush!” Judy reproved. “Don’t I look
dignified?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She tilted her hat a little more to the left
and dabbed a powder puff on her nose. The
puff happened not to have any powder on it but
it gave her a grown-up, courageous feeling.
And she was to have a great need of courage
in the hour that followed.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

<div>  <span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap04' class='c013'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>HOW THE SCHEME WORKED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The adventure lost some of its thrill with no
one to share it. Judy hadn’t an idea in the
world how to find the fourth floor as she could
see no stairway and no elevator.</p>

<p class='c005'>Taking a chance, she opened one of several
doors. It opened into a closet where cleaning
supplies were kept. Judy glanced at the dusty
floor and wondered if anybody ever used them.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was fun! She tried another door and
found it locked. But the third door opened into
a long hall at the end of which was the
stairway.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A regular labyrinth, this place,” she
thought as she climbed. “I wonder if Emily
Grimshaw will be as queer as her hotel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There were old-fashioned knockers on all the
doors, and Judy noticed that no two of them
were alike. Emily Grimshaw had her name on
the glass door of her suite, and the knocker
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>was in the shape of a witch hunched over a
steaming caldron. Judy lifted it and waited.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s there?” called a mannish voice from
within.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Judy Bolton. They told me at the desk
that you would see me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on in, then. Don’t stand there banging
the knocker.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon,” Judy said meekly as
she entered. “I didn’t quite understand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s all right. Who sent you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody. I came myself. I found your
name in the classified directory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I see. Another beginner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Emily Grimshaw sat back in her swivel chair
and scrutinized Judy. She was a large woman
dressed in a severely plain brown cloth dress
with sensible brown shoes to match. Her iron-gray
hair was knotted at the back of her head.
In fact, the only mark of distinction about her
whole person was the pair of glasses perched
on the high bridge of her nose and the wide,
black ribbon suspended from them. Although
an old woman, her face was not wrinkled.
What few lines she had were deep furrows that
looked as if they belonged there. Judy could
imagine Emily Grimshaw as a middle-aged
woman but never as a girl.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>The room was, by no means, a typical office.
If it had not been for the massive desk littered
with papers and the swivel chair it would not
have looked like an office at all. Three of the
four walls were lined with bookshelves.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is this where you do all your work?” Judy
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And why not? It’s a good enough place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course,” Judy explained herself quickly.
“But I supposed you would have girls working
for you. It must keep you busy doing all this
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hmm! It does. I like to be busy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy took a deep breath. How, she wondered,
was she to put her proposition before
this queer old woman without seeming impudent.
It was the first time in her life she had
ever offered her services to anyone except her
father.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You use a typewriter,” she began.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, young woman,” Emily Grimshaw
turned on her suddenly, “if you’re a
writer, say so. And if you’ve come here looking
for a position——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>“That’s it exactly,” Judy interrupted. “I’m
sure I could be of some service to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I might typewrite letters for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do that myself. Haven’t the patience to
dictate them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps I could help you read and correct
manuscripts,” Judy suggested hopefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>The agent seemed insulted. “Humph!” she
grunted. “Much you know about manuscripts!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I may know more than you think,” Judy
came back at her. It was hard to be patient
with this irritable old lady. Certainly she
would never have chosen such an employer if
it had not been for the possibility of meeting
Dale Meredith again. Irene had taken such a
fancy to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lucky she doesn’t know that,” thought
Judy as she watched her fumbling through a
stack of papers on her desk. Finally she produced
a closely written page of note paper and
handed it to the puzzled girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you know so much about manuscripts,”
she charged. “What would you do with a page
like that?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>Half hoping that the handwriting was Dale
Meredith’s, Judy reached out an eager hand.
The agent was watching her like a cat and, as
she read, a hush settled over the room. Emily
Grimshaw was putting Judy to a test.</p>

    <div>THE TEST</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The paper that Judy held in her hand was a
jumble of morbid poetry written in what could
have been a beautiful hand. Actually, it was
an almost unreadable scrawl. In some places
the rhymes were in perfect sequence, but in
others the poet had wandered away from what
must have been the theme to play with words
that apparently amused her. Finally Judy
made out this much:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When Love turns thief, grief, sheaf, oh, disbelief</div>

      <div class='line'>They say you’re dead. They lie!</div>
      <div class='line'>You cannot die!</div>
      <div class='line'>You drifted off in air</div>
      <div class='line'>To share</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>Your hair</div>
      <div class='line'>Your fair white skin,</div>
      <div class='line'>The very dress you wear.</div>
      <div class='line'>IT’S MINE! YOU’RE MINE!</div>

      <div class='line'>’Tis memories that burn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Better to crumble in a tower of flame</div>
      <div class='line'>Than sit with ghosts awaiting your return.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>How could anyone crumble in a tower of
flame, Judy wondered. Oh, well, she supposed
it was just a lot of melancholy words jumbled
together to give the reader the creeps. Certainly
she was not going to give Emily Grimshaw
the satisfaction of knowing that it had
impressed her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With the poet’s permission,” she looked up
and said, “I would take out a few lines and
then type the poem on a clean sheet of paper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have the poet’s permission,” Emily Grimshaw
replied shortly. And, after a pause,
“What lines would you take out?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Half of some of them and all of this one.”
Judy pointed. “The words ‘Joy’ and ‘toy’ are
repeated too many times.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>“That’s the first thing one notices,” the old
lady replied, evidently pleased with Judy’s suggestion.
“How do you like that poetry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I <i>don’t</i> like it,” the girl replied frankly.
“It sounds as if the writer had a distorted
idea of life. It depresses a person just to
read it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are people who like to be depressed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose so,” Judy answered wearily. She
could see that the conversation was getting
them nowhere, and Irene must be dreadfully
tired of waiting. Besides, she did not care to
stand and argue with as queer a person as
Emily Grimshaw seemed to be. Why, she was
more peculiar, even, than the matron at camp
or the queer old lady who ran the dog and cat
hospital.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would you like me to sit down and type the
poem for you now?” Judy suggested. “Then
you could see exactly what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The old lady consented with a wave of her
hand, and Judy set to work. The task was not
an easy one, and when she had finished cutting
out all the queer-sounding lines the poem was
about half its original length. Hardly knowing
whether to expect praise or criticism, she
handed the revised poem to Emily Grimshaw
and waited while she read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>When Love turns thief ’tis memories that sting;</div>
      <div class='line'>When Joy departs ’tis memories that burn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Better to crumble in a tower of flame</div>
      <div class='line'>Than sit with ghosts awaiting your return.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“These are the four best lines,” Judy pointed
out when she had finished reading. “I took out
parts of the first three lines and switched the
last three over toward the beginning. It’s more
coherent that way if anyone should ever try to
figure it out. But the middle stanza must either
stay as it is or be taken out entirely. Which
do you think, Miss Grimshaw?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d take it out,” she declared. “There’s
too much truth in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Too much truth? A person who could not
die! Who drifted off in air! Judy would have
said exactly the opposite. It was too impossible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t the poet explain what she meant
when the manuscript was delivered?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>“Explain it! Humph! Jasper Crosby expects
me to explain it. He’s the poet’s
brother,” the agent pointed out. “He brings
me the stuff in just such a jumble as this.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The pile before her on the desk eloquently
illustrated the word “jumble.” Old envelopes,
bills, sales sheets, anything that happened to be
about, had been used for the poet’s snatches
of verse.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It must take a lot of time to rearrange
them,” Judy ventured.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Time! That’s just it. Time and patience,
too. But Jasper Crosby cares as much about
the value of my time as a newborn baby. He
never talks except in terms of dollars and cents.
‘What can you make out of this?’ ‘How much
do we get out of that?’ And expects me to rewrite
half of it! It’s trying my patience to the
limit, I can tell you. If I weren’t so fond of the
poet I would have given it up years ago. Her
verses used to be of quite a different type. You
know <i>Golden Girl</i>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean the popular song? Of course
I do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, she wrote that twenty years ago. It’s
just recently been set to music.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>Judy was becoming interested. As well as
holding a promise of many new and charming
acquaintances for herself and the other two
girls the work was sure to be fascinating.
Emily Grimshaw seemed pleased with the
changes she had made in the poem, but it was
best not to hurry her decision. Judy could see
that she needed an assistant, but to make the
agent see it also would require tact and patience.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the course of another half hour Emily
Grimshaw had made up her mind. Judy was to
report at her office the following day. No mention
had been made of Irene as Judy knew her
chances of holding the position were slim
enough without asking an additional favor.
But she felt sure that her new employer would
not object to the presence of both girls in the
office after she had grown accustomed to the
idea of being helped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if she does object,” Irene said cheerfully,
“I’ll apply for a position with Dale
Meredith’s publisher.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Eager to tell Pauline of their adventure, they
walked toward the subway entrance and arrived
just as the school girls were coming home.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>“We found out who that man we met on the
bus is,” Judy announced the moment she saw
Pauline. “He’s an author and has written
stacks and stacks of books. We bought one to
read in our spare time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the honest truth,” Irene declared. “I
read ten chapters today while I was waiting for
Judy. And what do you think? She has accepted
a position in Emily Grimshaw’s office.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline stared. “The woman who sent that
telegram? Who on earth is she and where did
you find out?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the classified telephone directory,” Judy
confessed. “She’s Dale Meredith’s literary
agent, though why he should pick such a
crotchety old woman to sell his stories is beyond
me. I thought, at first, she was going to bite
my head off. But she found out she couldn’t
frighten me so she decided to hire me. When
she calms down a bit she’ll probably let Irene
help her, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>“Imagine!” Irene exclaimed, still bubbling
with enthusiasm, “our own spending money
and an opportunity to meet the most interesting
people——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean Dale Meredith?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Did Judy imagine it or was there the smallest
trace of bitterness in Pauline’s voice?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, perhaps I do,” Irene replied.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>THE NEW YELLOW GOWN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In spite of the opportunity presented, a
whole week passed by without a sign of the
handsome young author. Judy’s suggestion
that Irene might help in the office had been
flatly ignored, but she was still hoping that
Emily Grimshaw would change her mind. In
the meantime Irene occupied herself with Dale
Meredith’s books and Pauline’s piano.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little by little Judy became accustomed to
her employer’s eccentricities, and meeting unusual
people was an everyday occurrence. Jasper
Crosby, of all the people she met, was the
only one who seemed to resent her presence in
the office. He came in, bringing an old shoe
box stuffed with more poetry by the author of
<i>Golden Girl</i>. The box was poked full of tiny
holes. Judy’s curiosity got the better of her
and she asked the reason.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So the verses can breathe, simpleton,” he
replied. Then he turned to Emily Grimshaw,
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>“What’s the idea of this upstart in your office?
Getting old, eh? Work too much for you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you bring in any more of this stuff,”
the agent retorted, “it will be too much for
both of us. This girl is clever. She’s the only
person I ever met who can revise your sister’s
poetry as well as I can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Jasper Crosby’s hawk eyes were fixed
on Judy. He studied her for a moment while
she met his gaze unflinchingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huh!” he grunted. “Watch your step,
now. It takes queer people to revise queer
poetry, and, mind you, this stuff has got to
sell. Bring it out in book form. Jazz it up!
Make it popular, and the public will eat it.
That so, cutie?” He gave Judy’s cheek a playful
pinch as he turned to leave.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The nerve of him!” she expostulated.
“He’s the most repulsive person I have ever
seen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quite so,” the agent agreed. “Quite so
and, strange to say, his sister was once the
most charming. You can see it yet in some of
her verses. I would be more enthusiastic about
this book of her collected poems if I had any
assurance that the royalties would go to her.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>“Why won’t they?” Judy asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because he tells me that her health is failing.
Years ago I was witness to her will, and
the entire estate goes to that scoundrel, Jasper
Crosby.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Judy busied herself typing and correcting
the poetry this thought kept recurring to
her mind. Nevertheless, the work itself fascinated
her. She conceived the idea of grouping
the verses with a sub-title for each group. Miss
Grimshaw beamed her pleasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A fine idea, Miss Bolton, a really constructive
idea. It will take considerable time but
don’t try to hurry. Better keep the manuscripts
on your own desk and have the thing
done right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Could I take them home?” Judy ventured
the question and immediately wished she had
not asked it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The agent’s eyes snapped. “Indeed not!
Don’t you realize, young lady, that original
manuscripts are sometimes very valuable?
This poet is well known, and plenty of people
would be glad to buy them or, what’s worse,
steal them.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>Judy had not considered this. It had simply
occurred to her that Irene might help arrange
the poems. She liked to hear her read in her
low, musical voice. She would make the poems
live and catch hidden meanings between the
lines. Judy tried to explain all this to her employer.
She felt that she must excuse her own
thoughtlessness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, if you are so anxious to have your
friend help you, bring her here,” the old lady
said with a sudden show of generosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene was thrilled when Judy told her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feel as if this is a real occasion and I
ought to dress up for it,” she declared. “A
package came this morning from Farringdon,
and I’ve been suspecting all the time that it’s
a new dress. My birthday isn’t for another
week, but do you think Dad would mind if I
opened my present now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Without waiting for a reply, Irene ran to get
the box her father had labeled, <i>For My Little
Girl’s Seventeenth Birthday</i>. When she pulled
off the wrappings the folds of a shimmering
yellow satin dress fell into her hands. She
stood up, holding it for Judy and Pauline to
admire.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>“Gorgeous!” Judy exclaimed. “Look at the
puffed sleeves and high waistline! Why, it’s
the very newest thing!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it’s a party dress,” Pauline objected.
“Really, it’s not at all the thing to wear in
Emily Grimshaw’s office.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For once,” Irene announced, “I’m going
to wear exactly what I want to wear whether
it’s proper or not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy smiled at her independence. She had
often felt that way herself. After all, what difference
did it make? And Irene was breathtakingly
lovely in the new dress. She stood before
the long mirror in Pauline’s room while
Judy pinned her hair in soft, bright curls at
the back of her neck. Then she walked back
a little distance, surveying the effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re beautiful!” Judy exclaimed. “That
dress fits in with your complexion as though
you were part of a picture. You’re prettier
than Lois or Honey or Lorraine. Don’t you
think so, Pauline?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She admitted it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Prettier than Lorraine?” Irene repeated
wonderingly. Lorraine Lee had always considered
herself the prettiest girl in Farringdon
and dressed accordingly, while Irene’s faded
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>blues and browns had never flattered her. But
in the new yellow dress she was transformed.
There was a tiny jacket to go with it, also of
yellow but more delicately golden, matching
slippers and, in the very bottom of the box, a
gold locket. Irene, delighting in her own recklessness,
wore them all the next morning.</p>

    <div>EMILY GRIMSHAW SEES THINGS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Emily Grimshaw often came in late, but as
Judy had her own key this affected her work
very little. In fact, she usually accomplished
more when alone. Thus she was not surprised
to find the office vacant when she and Irene arrived.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s every bit as queer as you said it was,”
Irene whispered as they unlocked the door and
she examined the brass knocker. “She must
trust you, Judy.” She smiled into her friend’s
honest gray eyes. “And who wouldn’t?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The girls seated themselves at either end
of the long sofa in Emily Grimshaw’s office.
With the pile of handwritten poetry between
them it was easier to help each other decide into
which group certain verses belonged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some of them are rather horrible,” Judy
remarked as she hunted through the pile. “I’ll
sort out the worst ones, and you can read the
others.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>“Oh, no! Let me read the horrible ones,”
Irene begged.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy laughed. “Everyone to his own notions.
I don’t mind, if you feel like giving
yourself the shivers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a long table just back of the sofa,
and it came in handy for the completed groups
of papers. Judy removed a vase of flowers and
a few books and made a clear place for the different
piles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Golden Girl</i> goes at the top of the list,” she
remarked, as she took a yellowed slip of paper
in her hand. “Miss Grimshaw says it’s
valuable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it the song?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is,” Judy replied. “This poet wrote it.
Imagine! And then turns to such morbid things
as that one I fixed up; you remember, about
the tower of flame?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She broke off suddenly as the telephone on
Emily Grimshaw’s desk jangled imperiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both girls were buried in papers, and the
telephone rang a second time before Judy was
free to answer it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The switchboard operator says it’s Dale
Meredith!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>She turned away from the mouthpiece and
gave out this information in an excited whisper.
Irene let a few of the papers slide to the floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Judy,” she cried, “our scheme did
work after all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy’s answer was a glance of triumph, but
her voice over the wire sounded very businesslike.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell him to come up and wait. Miss Grimshaw
will be in shortly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the moment before he mounted the stairs
Irene had time to smooth her hair and powder
her nose. Then she picked up the fallen papers
and was about to place them on the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind the work now. I’ll straighten
things,” Judy told her. “You just sit there
and look pretty when Dale Meredith comes in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The handsome young author greeted them
with a surprised whistle. “Whoever expected
to find you here!” he exclaimed, smiling first
at Judy who stood beside the open door and
then at Irene. “Why, the place looks like a
palace with the princess enthroned on the sofa.
What’s happened to Her Royal Highness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean Miss Grimshaw?” Judy asked,
laughing. “She will be in presently.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>“Not too ‘presently,’ I hope,” Dale replied,
seating himself beside Irene. “Before we talk
business I want to hear what happened to you
girls. I’ve been scolding myself ever since for
not finding out your names. The truth of the
matter is, I was so dog-goned interested in that
<i>Art Shop Robbery</i>——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The title of your new book?” Judy ventured,
and his nod told her that she had reasoned
correctly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see, it was a rush order,” he went on
to explain. “There seems to be a big demand
for mystery stories. Most people like to imagine
themselves as sleuths or big time detectives.
I do, myself. The trouble is, there
aren’t enough mysteries in real life to supply
the demand for plots, and what there are make
tales too gruesome to be good reading.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do write gruesome stories then?” Irene
asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>He studied her face for a moment before he
answered. “That depends on your definition
of the word. I never make it a point to dwell
on the details of a murder. Suffice it to tell
under what circumstances the body was
found——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>“Don’t talk about it, please! You sound so
cold and matter-of-fact, as if you didn’t feel
it at all. Your flying stories are so different!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They were written from first-hand knowledge,”
he explained. “I had a pilot’s license
and flew with a friend of mine across the continent.
There was story material and plenty
of it!” He went on for fifteen minutes discussing
his experiences with the girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale Meredith had a knack of telling stories
so that the listeners lived his adventures with
him. Judy and Irene sat enthralled. They were
both imagining themselves scrambling out of a
wrecked plane in their own Allegheny Mountains
when the door opened, and in walked
Emily Grimshaw! Dale and Judy both greeted
her, but when Irene looked up and smiled the
old lady started back as if she had seen a ghost.
Judy, thinking she must be ill, helped her into
a chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is there anything I can do?” she asked solicitously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s a bottle.” Emily Grimshaw made
a gesture with her hand. “Pour me out a bit.
I need a stimulant. I must be getting old.
Good lord! I must be seeing things!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>She took the glass that Judy held out to her
and swallowed the contents in three great
gulps, then rubbed her eyes and looked at Irene
again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess the stuff is too strong,” she muttered
and slumped in her chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene clutched Dale’s arm. “She isn’t going
to die?” she asked in a panicky whisper.</p>

<p class='c005'>More than a little bewildered, the young man
reassured her and suggested that she wait
downstairs in the lobby.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She seems to have affected Miss Grimshaw
strangely,” he explained to Judy later.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and Irene can’t stand too much excitement,”
she returned. “You didn’t know, but
for the past three years she’s been working almost
day and night, taking care of her crippled
father. She’d be doing it yet if my dad hadn’t
arranged to have him cared for in a sanitarium.
It’s better for him and better for Irene.
Her mother is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor kid! No wonder she thought something
dreadful had happened to Her Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy had gone for a pitcher of water and
stood beside her employer’s chair dampening
her handkerchief and rubbing her forehead.
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>That seemed to have little effect, but when Dale
attempted to move her to the sofa the old lady
promptly opened her eyes and protested violently.
She staggered back to her chair and
sat there staring at the spot where Irene had
sat. Then she sighed heavily. “Old fool that
I am—seeing things.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>THE MISSING POEMS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The agent’s collapse had unnerved Judy
more than a little, and it was some time before
she settled herself to her work. Dale had left
but not before promising to see Irene safely
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She probably won’t want to come near the
office again,” Judy thought. “Poor Irene! I
wonder what made Emily Grimshaw act up and
scare her so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But this was no time for deductions, Judy
knew, when so much work remained to be done—twice
as much now. And there was no use
sitting in comfort on the sofa, either. Alone,
she could group the poems better at her own
desk.</p>

<p class='c005'>She lowered the typewriter until a place was
clear above it and then went for the pile of
manuscripts. She looked on the table back of
the sofa, but they were not there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s queer,” she thought. “I’m sure we
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>left them right on the corner of that table. I
saw Irene when she put <i>Golden Girl</i> back, and
it was right on top. But maybe she moved
them afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Next Judy looked on the sofa and under all
three cushions. She felt beneath the arms, then
got down on her hands and knees and looked
under the sofa on the floor. She even lifted
the rug and looked under that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What <i>are</i> you doing?” Emily Grimshaw inquired,
looking up with a scowl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hunting for something,” Judy answered
vaguely. She was not ready to tell her employer
that the manuscripts were missing, not
after having been told how valuable they were.
Perhaps, absent-mindedly she had placed them
in one of the drawers of her own desk.</p>

<p class='c005'>After another ten minutes of Judy’s frantic
searching the agent’s patience was exhausted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sit down, young lady, and tell me why you
are turning my office upside down in this ridiculous
fashion. As if I hadn’t enough worries!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sorry, Miss Grimshaw,” Judy replied
contritely. “But the poems you gave me—the
originals, I mean—they seem to have—disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>“Disappeared! Stuff and nonsense!” the
old lady snorted. “Like all girls, you’ve been
careless, and misplaced them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve looked everywhere except in your desk,
and they couldn’t be there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They couldn’t, eh? We shall see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon the agent had her own desk in worse
confusion than Judy’s, but no papers could she
find. She poured herself another drink from
the bottle and regarded Judy with a wild light
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Joy Holiday took them! That’s what happened!
I knew that girl was here for a reason.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After that there was a long silence during
which Emily Grimshaw sat moving her lips but
making no sound. It was uncanny! Judy
longed for five o’clock and freedom from her
queer employer.</p>

<p class='c005'>No one had entered the office; of that Judy
felt sure. The sofa was opposite the door.
No one could have passed it and taken the pile
of papers from the table without being seen.
And no one could enter without a key. The
door locked from the inside, and Judy never
left the catch off except when Emily Grimshaw
was there. That had been her employer’s instructions,
and she had followed them to the
letter.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>What, then, could she mean by saying Joy
Holiday took the poems? Why had she collapsed
the moment Irene looked up at her, and
who or what had taken the pile of manuscripts?</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy shivered. Would it be stretching the
truth to say that some strange, invisible force
had been at work in the office that day? Irene,
timid, lovable little girl that she was, couldn’t
possibly frighten a big capable woman like
Emily Grimshaw. She must have seen something
else!</p>

<p class='c005'>Without meaning to, Judy glanced over her
shoulder. Then a thought came to her that
seemed all at once amusing. Dale Meredith
had said there weren’t enough mysteries in real
life. Wait till she told him this one! A writer
of detective stories ought to be interested. He
might even have a theory, perhaps from his
own novels, that would work out a solution.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or perhaps Dale knew what had happened to
the poetry. He didn’t seem dishonest, but if
he refused to show an interest or showed too
great an interest.... How was it that people
told the guilty party?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>These questions ran through Judy’s mind
as she sat before her typewriter. Mysteries
intrigued her. But no mystery on earth would
be worth the solving if it lessened her trust in
people she loved.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There has to be some way to get Irene out
of this,” she said to herself. “Whatever Emily
Grimshaw saw, she mustn’t be allowed to accuse
Irene of taking the poetry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then it occurred to Judy that, ordinarily,
she would be under suspicion as well. Instead,
Emily Grimshaw suspected someone named Joy
Holiday. It sounded like an hallucination.</p>

<p class='c005'>When closing time came, Judy walked in the
direction of Gramercy Park and arrived at Dr.
Faulkner’s house just as Pauline was leaving
through a side door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are you going?” Judy asked in surprise.
Usually Pauline would not be going out
just at dinner time.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told Mary I’d not be home,” Pauline replied,
“and you had better not be, either. Dale
Meredith’s up on the roof garden with Irene,
and we would be intruding if we thrust ourselves
upon them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why? What makes you think that?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>“Just what I overheard.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps you didn’t understand,” Judy attempted.
“There’s a brand-new mystery for
us to solve. I’m sure Dale Meredith wants to
hear about it. Something happened in the office
today, and Irene was dreadfully upset. He
may have been trying to comfort her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline laughed bitterly. “A queer way of
doing it—calling her a sweet girl, holding her
hand and saying something about ‘another roof
garden ... peppy orchestra, floor as smooth
as wax ... and you to dance with....’ He
said more, too, but that was all I heard. You
see what a mistake I almost made! Of course
he wants Irene to himself. He won’t be interested
in your mystery now—only in Irene’s
glorious eyes and her bright hair. I guess she
knew what she was doing when she wore that
party dress.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You wouldn’t feel that way if you knew
how little pleasure Irene has had in her life,”
Judy said. “My brother is the only boy who
ever paid any attention to her, and he never
took her out alone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That doesn’t excuse her for dolling up on
purpose to attract Dale Meredith.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>“Why, she didn’t even know he was going to
come into the office! She dressed up only because
it pleased her to look pretty. It pleased
me, too,” Judy added warmly. “Do you think
they have really gone out together, Pauline?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sure of it. And she doesn’t deserve it
after scheming to meet him. I’ll never quite
forgive her, and you’re a little bit to blame, too.
It wasn’t just the thing to go off and find yourself
a position when you are really my guest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose it wasn’t,” Judy admitted, feeling
sorry for Pauline in spite of the attitude
she had taken. She couldn’t be blamed too
much. It promised to be another one of these
eternal triangles. Judy thought of Peter Dobbs
and Arthur Farringdon-Pett at home. They
both liked her and were still good friends to
each other. She thought of Horace and Honey
and Irene. One triangle made straight, only
to be converted into another and more puzzling
one. Why couldn’t Dale Meredith take out both
Pauline and Irene, she wondered. She would
even be willing to tag along if it would help.
But tonight she would tag along with Pauline
and sympathize.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>They had hot chocolate and sandwiches in a
drug store and called it their dinner. After
that they walked uptown as far as Central Park
and then back again in time to see the last show
at a near-by movie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No need to hurry,” Judy said. “Irene is
sure to be home late if she and Dale Meredith
went out to dance.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>SUSPICIONS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was twelve o’clock when Judy and Pauline,
her head held high, walked into the house. All
the lights were on and the radio was going in
Pauline’s parlor room, but, as no one was there,
they went on through to the roof garden. Irene
looked up from the hammock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, there you are!” she exclaimed. “Dale
and I have been so worried. We couldn’t imagine
where you were.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline noticed the familiar use of his first
name and winced. The young author had been
sitting beside Irene, and now he rose and stood
smiling. Again Pauline felt as if she wanted
to run away, but this time it was impossible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy excused their lateness as well as she
could without telling them she expected that
they would be dancing. Irene soon explained
that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You missed the most wonderful time,” she
said. “Dale was going to take us to a hotel
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>roof garden to dance, but when you didn’t come
in we had to wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You could have left a note,” Pauline replied.
“I’m sorry to have spoiled your date.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It isn’t spoiled,” Dale returned. “With
your consent, we are going tomorrow night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why <i>with my consent</i>? Irene is old enough
to take care of herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But can’t you see?” he protested. “I want
all three of you to come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can leave me out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Pauline,” Irene exclaimed, “I
thought——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind what you thought,” Judy interrupted.
She knew that Irene had been about
to say she thought Pauline wanted to meet interesting
people. Then Dale would know she
thought him interesting, and that wouldn’t be a
very good thing to reveal right then. But Judy
spoke more sharply than she realized, and her
tone held the smallest hint of suspicion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene’s expressive eyes were dark with reproach.
“Judy!” she cried, almost in tears,
“Now what have I done to offend you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing, dear. Nothing at all. I’m just
tired.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>“You must be tired,” Dale put in. “Who
wouldn’t be, after such a hectic day? But why
take it out on Irene? She isn’t to blame if Her
Majesty makes a grouch of herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course not,” Judy agreed, not quite sure
that she spoke the truth. Certainly Irene <i>had</i>
had something to do with Emily Grimshaw’s
grouch for the old lady had not been herself
since the moment she set eyes on the dainty
figure in yellow, curled on her sofa in the office
that morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t know the half of it,” she went on
to explain. “Her Majesty, as you call her,
acted queer and talked to herself like a crazy
person all day. I didn’t dare speak to her for
fear she’d go off in a fit again. She thinks
someone, or something, came into the office.
Did you ever hear of a person named Joy
Holiday?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, never,” Dale replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Judy turned to Irene. “Did you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know I didn’t,” she replied in surprise.
“Why, Judy, you know everyone I know at
home, and I have no friends here except Pauline.
Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>“Because Emily Grimshaw thinks someone
named Joy Holiday took those poems that were
lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What poems?” asked Pauline.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The ones Irene and I were reading this
morning. Something happened to them. They
aren’t anywhere. Of course someone took them,
but the strange part of it is, we were the only
ones in the office.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you missed them right after Emily
Grimshaw had that queer spell and collapsed?”
Dale asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pretty soon afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought there was something fishy about
that at the time,” he declared, “and I shouldn’t
be a bit surprised if the old lady made away
with them herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why should she? What would be her
object in taking poems she expected to publish
and then pretending not to know what happened
to them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s beyond me! Maybe she didn’t. They
might have been accidentally brushed off the
table when someone passed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In that case they would have been on the
floor,” Judy replied.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>Dale Meredith was coming to some rapid conclusions,
she thought—too rapid to be sincere
expressions of his opinion. But what use could
a successful young author make of faded manuscripts
of melancholy poetry. A plot for a
story, perhaps. That was pure inspiration!
Those queer old poems might furnish plots for
a great many mystery stories if anyone had the
patience to figure them out. Ghosts ...
towers ... thrills ... shivers ... creeps....
Dale Meredith could do it, too. All he needed
was a little time to study the originals. The
revised poems with corrections and omissions,
Judy could see, wouldn’t do half so well.</p>

<p class='c005'>But that would be cheating, stealing. No,
there was another word for it—plagiarizing.
That was it. But Judy had hoped that Dale
was too fine a man to stoop to anything like
that, even to further the interests of his stories.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Better to crumble in a tower of flame....”</p>

<p class='c005'>A line from one of the missing poems, but it
did ring true. It was far better that Judy’s
plans for both her friends should crumble before
the flame that was her passion for finding
out the truth.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>When she came into the room she had noticed
Dale Meredith’s portfolio on top of the radio.
It was the same portfolio that he had carried
on the bus, the same portfolio that he had taken
away with him when he left Emily Grimshaw’s
office. Now Judy remembered watching Dale
and Irene from the office window as they walked
through Madison Square. Irene had carried
nothing except her brown hand bag. That was
far too small to hold the manuscript. But
Dale’s portfolio——Why, even now it bulged
with papers that must be inside! Yes, Judy
had to face it, Dale Meredith might have taken
the poems. They might be inside that very
portfolio!</p>

<p class='c005'>Excusing herself, she went inside. Blackberry
followed at her heels.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>DEDUCTIONS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Torn between a desire to find out what had
actually happened and a fear of throwing suspicion
upon the man who was Irene’s ideal,
Judy stood in the center of the room staring at
Dale Meredith’s portfolio. Blackberry sat on
the floor at her feet, and the thumping of his
tail on the rug played a drumlike march in time
to her heartbeats. This was nonsense—just
standing there. It was her duty to find out the
truth.</p>

<p class='c005'>She took a quick step forward and reached
for the portfolio, accidentally stepping on the
cat’s tail. He yowled! Judy almost dropped
the papers that she held, caught at them, told in
one glance that she had been wrong and was
about to put them back when the door slowly
opened.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>There was no way out. Dale and the two
girls came into the room, stopped and stood
speechless. Blackberry looked up at them as
though expecting to be commended for sounding
the warning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That cat’s as good as a watchdog,” Dale
broke the silence by saying.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose I do look something like a burglar,”
Judy retorted. “I’m not going to
apologize for anything either. I simply had to
know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Know what?” Pauline asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She wanted to find out if I took the lost
poetry,” Dale explained. “That’s clear enough,
and don’t think for a moment that I blame her.
Any good detective would have done the same
thing. Being a comparative stranger, I am the
logical one to suspect. Irene, we all know, is
above suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well then, who did take the papers?” Pauline
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale only shook his head, refusing to propound
any more theories about the affair. Judy
turned to him gratefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I felt sure you would be dreadfully mad at
me for snooping in your personal belongings,”
she said. “It’s nice to have you uphold me in
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>my crude bit of detecting, and I do appreciate
it. What puzzles me is this: nobody left the
room ahead of you except——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Except me,” Irene broke in, “and you may
be sure I didn’t take those papers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re sure, aren’t we?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy turned to the others and Dale nodded
solemnly. It was Pauline who looked a little
doubtful.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! Don’t you believe in her too?” Judy
asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline shrugged. “I suppose so, if she says
she didn’t take them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we all believe in each other, and it
seems that even Emily Grimshaw believes in
us,” Judy went on. “It appears that the next
thing to do is find out who Joy Holiday is and
how she could have entered the office without
our knowing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re pretty keen on solving this mystery,
aren’t you?” Dale inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s just the way I am,” Judy replied. “I
couldn’t bear not knowing. And I suspect that
this Joy Holiday, whoever she is, had something
to do with Miss Grimshaw’s collapse.
Maybe tomorrow, if she’s in a pleasant mood,
I’ll ask her about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>“Go easy,” Dale warned. “I’m beginning to
think there’s more to this missing poetry business
than may appear on the surface. What
were they—very valuable manuscripts?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Valuable?” Judy repeated thoughtfully.
“Why, I believe they were.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There was <i>Golden Girl</i>,” Irene put in.
“You said that was valuable. It’s beautiful,
too. I read it over and over and over——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re getting sleepy, Irene. And no wonder!”
Pauline looked at her wrist watch a second
time to make sure. Then she turned to
Dale. “One o’clock! Oh, what a calling down
I’ll get from Father if the housekeeper catches
sight of you leaving at this hour of the night.
Better tiptoe down the back stairs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Okay! How about that roof garden tomorrow
night?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not tomorrow night,” Irene pleaded. “I’ll
be too tired. Can’t we wait?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Saturday, then. How about it, Pauline?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said I wasn’t going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you must go. We won’t go without her,
will we, Irene?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>She shook her bright head and laughed, “Indeed
we won’t. Don’t be a goose!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Did they want her, too, Judy wondered. Then
she thought of Emily Grimshaw, and her doubts
vanished. She might have something interesting
to tell them about Joy Holiday.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>WHILE THE ORCHESTRA PLAYED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Saturday night came, and when Dale Meredith
called, three visions of loveliness awaited
him. Pauline wore peach-colored satin that
trailed nearly to the floor. Irene’s new yellow
dress with matching slippers of gold was truly
appropriate for this occasion, and Judy looked
like a sea nymph in a pale shade of green that
made people wonder about the color of her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s going to be a perfect evening,” Irene
sighed ecstatically. “Even the moon came out
to shine on the roof garden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was all that Dale had described—palms,
cut flowers, waiters in long-tailed coats who
moved noiselessly between the tables, and a
circle of floor for dancing. Colored lights played
on the dancers tinting them with rainbows. To
her surprise, Dale asked Judy for the first
dance.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>“Oh, no,” she replied quickly. “Really, I’d
rather you danced with the other girls. You
see, I can watch the lights while I’m sitting
here. When I’m home again I won’t be able to
watch lights on a roof garden. And I can always
dance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Afterwards Judy felt almost sorry she had
refused. The orchestra was playing beautifully,
magic to any young girl’s feet. Now and
then a soloist would sing the number as it was
played. Judy listened, at first watching Dale
and Irene, then Dale and Pauline as they moved
in and out among the crowd of dancers.
Finally, not watching anybody, she just sat
thinking.</p>

<p class='c005'>It had been a queer day. Strangely enough,
Emily Grimshaw had not once mentioned the
missing poetry. She seemed to take it for
granted that neither Dale nor Judy were responsible.
But she had gone about her work
with a harassed expression and a droop to her
shoulders that Judy had never noticed before.
An opportunity came, and she had asked about
Joy Holiday. She had found out something,
too, and now as she sat alone at the table she
puzzled as how best to tell Dale Meredith. At
first she had planned to tell Irene but, on second
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>thought, she had decided that it might be better
for Irene not to know some of the things Emily
Grimshaw had said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must dance this one,” Dale urged her
as the music began again. “Pauline is dancing
with a friend of mine who just came in——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I haven’t had a chance to finish this
ginger ale,” Irene added.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale was curious to hear what she had found
out. Judy could tell that as soon as he spoke
to her alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her Majesty’s grouch gone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A sort of depression has taken its place,”
Judy explained as she swung into step. The
floor was like glass and shone with their reflections.
She could see Irene sitting next to
the circle of light, sipping her ginger ale. There
was another girl reflected on the floor beside
her. Judy pointed it out to Dale—that golden
reflection on the polished floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then the orchestra struck up a new tune.
Soon the soloist joined in, singing the latest
popular song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>My own golden girl, there is one, only one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who has eyes like the stars and hair like the sun.</div>
      <div class='line'>In your new yellow gown you’re a dream of delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>You have danced in my heart on bright slippers tonight ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“It sounds as if he meant Irene,” Dale whispered.
“She’s a ‘golden girl’ tonight.” He
glanced again at her reflection as the orchestra
played on:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’ll enthrone you my queen in a circular tower</div>
      <div class='line'>Where frost may not blight my most delicate flower.</div>
      <div class='line'>And from this hour on, you belong all to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Though you drown in my love as a bird in the sea.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Irene looked up just as the music stopped.
She smiled, and Dale’s eyes smiled back at her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her hair is like the sun,” he said dreamily
and half to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Judy replied. “And her dress and
slippers are golden. You’d almost think the
song was written for her. It must have been
written for someone very much like her, and
whoever wrote it loved that someone dearly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was the poet’s name?” Dale asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy thought a minute. “It was Sarah
Glynn—or Glenn. I don’t quite remember. I
used to think the song was written by a man
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>until Miss Grimshaw showed me the original
manuscript. It’s one of the missing poems,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you didn’t find out a thing about it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, one thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale’s face glowed with interest. “You did?
What?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That Emily Grimshaw believes Irene’s
name is Joy Holiday. I can’t convince her
otherwise. And she is sure Joy Holiday took
the poems. You know it’s ridiculous. Irene
isn’t anybody but herself and wouldn’t have
any use in the world for the faded old poetry.
Besides, she said she didn’t take them, and I
believe her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep on believing her,” Dale advised as he
ushered Judy back to the table. “My own
opinion is that your beloved employer has
worked a screw loose somewhere in her upper
story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy giggled, partly from excitement. But
the thought would be less entertaining when she
was catering to the old lady’s whims at the
office.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>On the way home they discussed the mystery.
When questioned, Irene seemed glad to contribute
scraps of the missing poetry for the
others to puzzle over. It was remarkable how
much of it she remembered, and Dale was
charmed with the soft tones of her voice as she
recited.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the word “Joy” came up for the fifth
time Judy stopped her to exclaim, “That must
mean Joy Holiday, the girl Emily Grimshaw
thinks took the poetry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then she must have been ‘Golden Girl,’”
Irene said unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale turned to her in surprise. “That’s
right! We never thought of that. I’m glad to
see you so interested in it; I thought at first
you weren’t keen on detecting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not,” Irene admitted. “It’s the poetry
I like.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy shuddered. “Those creepy poems!
I’d rather read a good murder mystery any
day. At least there’s always a solution. What
do you suppose this poet means when she says
‘Better to crumble in a tower of flame than sit
with ghosts...’? Could the ghosts be memories,
too?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They could be,” Irene said thoughtfully.
“It’s queer, but <i>Golden Girl</i> mentions a tower.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>“So it does!” Dale exclaimed, growing excited.
“It looks as though there might be some
connection. Do you know, girls, we may find
the solution to this whole mystery in that
poetry!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have some of the typewritten copies. I’ll
hunt through them for clues,” Judy promised.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>IRENE’S BIRTHDAY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Unexpectedly, the next day Jasper Crosby
came into the office with another lot of his
sister’s poems. This time they were in a tin
box with padlock attached.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy listened in silence as the earlier manuscripts
were discussed, wondering how Emily
Grimshaw would break the news of their disappearance.
Presently she realized that the
poet’s brother was being kept in ignorance of
the whole affair. Worse than that, he was being
deceived. What did the agent mean by
saying the publishers were considering Sarah
Glenn’s work?</p>

<p class='c005'>Thinking there might be some mistake, Judy
refrained from asking questions until she and
her employer were alone again. Then she expressed
herself frankly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It isn’t right,” she declared, “not to tell
him the truth about those poems. We can’t
publish them when they’re lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>“Tut, tut, child,” Miss Grimshaw reproved
in a patronizing tone that always annoyed Judy.
“You must never correct your elders. Haven’t
you heard that there are tricks to all trades?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not dishonest tricks.” Judy’s scruples
about deceit and treachery had made her over-bold.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, Miss Bolton,” her employer
cried. “If this position means anything to you,
learn to keep a civil tongue in your head. I
have evidence enough against you right now to
place the blame on your shoulders if I wanted
to. The idea! Talking about dishonest tricks!
Wasn’t it a dishonest trick that somebody
played on me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Miss Grimshaw,” Judy answered penitently.
“I shouldn’t have spoken so hastily,
and if you blame me....”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I don’t blame you, child. You’re as
innocent as I am. That’s why I hired you—because
I knew I could trust you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This unexpected praise brought a flood of
color to Judy’s cheeks. She mumbled something
intended for an acknowledgment. Not
hearing the interruption, her employer went on
talking.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>“I know we can’t keep putting Jasper Crosby
off forever, but, don’t you see, we must do it
until the poems are found? I’m ruined if we
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose he would hold you responsible,”
Judy ventured.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He would exactly,” the agent declared.
“He’d charge me with gross negligence or
something of the kind and sue me for more
money than Sarah Glenn’s royalties would
bring in a lifetime. He’s just crooked enough
to get away with it. And,” she finished tragically,
“all our time and work will go for nothing.
Oh, Miss Bolton, if you can help me, won’t
you do it? You’re clever. Perhaps you can
figure it out. My mind gets all befuddled of
late—ever since Joy Holiday came back. Find
her. She’s got the papers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll do my best,” Judy promised, genuinely
moved. She resolved to tackle this new task
her employer had given her with all the seriousness
it demanded. But whom was there to suspect?
Joy Holiday, as far as she could figure
out, was a creature of Miss Grimshaw’s imagination,
a ghost. Judy refused to believe in
ghosts or be frightened by them. That angle
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>of the mystery she dismissed as wholly implausible.
She had proved Dale Meredith’s
innocence to her own satisfaction, and Irene
hadn’t taken the poetry. Judy felt sure of that.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was still sure the following Thursday
when she and Pauline planned a birthday party
for her. Dale happened to come in the office,
and Judy told him. Together they arranged a
surprise dinner. At first he wanted to take
them to an exclusive restaurant but was soon
won over when Judy suggested a meal served
out on the roof garden. Pauline liked the idea,
too, and found a great deal of pleasure in planning
the menu. She telephoned to the market
and ordered a good-sized capon; nuts, celery
and raisins were to go into the dressing. There
would be fruit cups and salads, and ice cream
for dessert and, of course, a cake with candles.
Judy came home early to make the cake. While
Pauline helped Mary put on the roast she continued
fixing things, waiting for Dale who expected
to arrive ahead of Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It looks great!” he exclaimed as soon as he
opened the door and saw the table set in the
center of the roof garden. It was decorated
with yellow candy cups and tall yellow candles.
“And isn’t it lucky that I brought yellow
flowers?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>“You knew we’d be decorating in yellow,”
Pauline charged as she took the flowers and
buried her face in their fragrance. Then, while
Dale stood admiring the tasteful arrangement
of the table, she placed them as an appropriate
centerpiece. Everything was ready, and it was
after six o’clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene ought to be here,” Judy said anxiously.
“I wonder where she went.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline had seen her go out early that morning,
carrying a borrowed book.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’d stop in on her way home to return
it. Dale, why don’t you and Judy go down to
the bookstore and meet her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can’t you leave the dinner long enough to
come with us?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline laughed. “I guess I could if you want
me. There’s a chance of missing her, though.
She may come from another direction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale helped Judy and Pauline with their
wraps, and together they walked toward the
bookstore. It was only a short distance, but
the cool air felt good to Judy after having spent
all afternoon over the cake. As they walked
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>they watched for Irene. She would be wearing
a brown suit with a close-fitting brown hat to
match, Pauline said. The outfit was new and
she wondered if, for that reason, they had
missed her.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the bookstore, however, the girl who took
care of lending out books from the circulating
library told them that Miss Lang had not been
in since morning when she returned a book.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What could have happened to her?” Judy
exclaimed in real concern.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps she went out shopping to celebrate.
I’ve seen girls shop before. They never leave
the stores until closing time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s closing time now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And she’ll probably be waiting for us back
at the house,” Dale prophesied cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” exclaimed Judy, “I hope she doesn’t
peek in the ice box and see her cake. I do believe
I forgot to put Blackberry out, and if he
smells that chicken....” She finished the sentence
with a gesture of hopelessness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Blackberry was out—out on the roof garden—when
they returned. Sensing a party in the
air, he had taken advantage of his mistress’ absence
and upset the vase of yellow flowers.
There were bits of chewed flower petals and
ferns scattered all about.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>“You bad cat!” cried Judy, shaking him.
“Just look what he’s done. And Irene isn’t
here yet! Let’s hurry and put the place in
order before she comes. Collect the flowers,
Dale, won’t you? I think I can save a few of
these ferns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was on her knees, hunting for pieces of
them as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I’ll get Mary to wipe up the water and
put on a clean cloth,” Pauline offered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon everything was in order again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oliver had hung a string of Japanese lanterns
all the way across the roof garden. They were
a little too low, and for a few more minutes
Dale and the girls busied themselves with a
pole, raising them to a higher level.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile it had grown dark, and Judy suggested
lighting the candles on the table so that
Irene would see them the moment she opened
the door. Then they planned to call out, “Surprise!”
all at once. Judy could imagine the
rest—Irene laughing, exclaiming, her two eyes
like stars as she enjoyed her very first birthday
party.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>In the kitchen below a sizzling noise called
Mary to the oven. The roast needed basting
again. It was too brown already, but she
couldn’t take it off and let it get cold. The
potatoes had cracked open and their jackets
were done to a crisp. She turned the flame as
low as she dared and faced about to see Dale
and the girls standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Getting hungry?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A little. Irene ought to be here by now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it,” the housekeeper replied, “and
the dinner will be spoiled if we let it wait much
longer.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>WAITING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Eight o’clock came and still no Irene. By
nine o’clock Judy was in tears. She felt that
something dreadful must have happened and
suggested calling up hospitals to see if there
had been any accidents. After the calls were
completed Dale returned to the kitchen and
stood looking at the dinner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You might as well eat some of the chicken,”
Mary suggested. She placed it on a platter and
carried it up to the roof garden, but they ate
only a little, cut from underneath where it
wouldn’t show. Then they left the table as it
was, waiting for Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'>The yellow candles burned lower and lower.
Finally they flickered and went out. Pauline
gave a little start, but Judy sank back in her
chair shaking with sobs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I’m not superstitious,” she blurted out.
“I’m trying to be sensible about it, but do you
think it’s sensible just to wait?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>“There isn’t anything else to do unless we
notify the police, and then, if she had just been
to a movie, wouldn’t she have the laugh on us?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Pauline, she isn’t thoughtless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I could tell that,” Dale put in seriously.
“She’s a mighty fine little girl. I know how you
feel, Judy. I’ll stand by. Didn’t Irene and I
wait up that night for you—and nothing had
happened except that you took a walk?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale was comforting. It was nice to have
him there, especially when Judy knew that he
was as interested as she in Irene’s safe return.
But Judy could not help thinking of Farringdon
and the enthusiasm with which the boys
there would help her if they only knew.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline thought of Farringdon too.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe Irene didn’t like it here in New York
and went home,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the house is empty,” Judy objected.
“There really isn’t any home in Farringdon
for her to go back to. She doesn’t even
know where they are going to live when her
father is well again. He’s in a sanitarium now,
and I hate to notify him if there’s any other
way. It really would be better to notify the
police.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>“I guess you’re right,” Dale agreed. “If
she isn’t home by midnight we might try it.
Things do happen—and especially to pretty
girls,” he added gravely.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was five minutes to twelve when footsteps
were finally heard outside the door. Dale
started to his feet, and Judy rushed toward the
door, then halted with a cry of disappointment
as she recognized the now familiar, “Hit’s
Oliver, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline opened the door and urged him to
come in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene isn’t home yet, and Mr. Meredith was
waiting,” she explained. “Did you happen to
see her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, let me think a minute.” The English
servant passed his fingers through his thinning
hair. “Indeed, yes, Miss Pauline, I did see her
when the post came this morning. She stood
hin the vestibule reading a letter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did she seem worried, as if it were bad
news?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man shook his head. “Indeed, she
seemed quite ’appy over hit. She went out a
bit later ’umming a tune, ‘De de-de da de. Da
de da. Da de dum’—like that.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>He had given a crude imitation of the first
notes of <i>Golden Girl</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She was very fond of that song,” Dale remarked
after Oliver had left. He was helping
the girls with their wraps preparatory to calling
at the police station.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Judy thought about the papers. Could
their disappearance and Irene’s, in some way,
be connected? She mentioned the possibility
to Dale but he thought it unlikely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At any rate we know Irene didn’t take them,
and when we make our report to the police we
had better leave the papers entirely out of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the name ‘Joy Holiday’?” Pauline
questioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, for the present. We want to do all
we can to save her from embarrassment until
we have an explanation. I feel sure that, whatever
it is, it will be—like Irene—satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad you believe in her, Dale,” Judy
said. She hoped, with all her heart, that Irene
would prove herself worthy of his loyalty.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the police station the sergeant on night
duty at the desk did not take their story very
seriously. He had a great many such cases, he
explained, most of which solved themselves.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>His questions, however, suggested terrifying
possibilities. Did she have any enemies, any
rejected suitors, any hostile relatives? Was
she wearing any valuable jewels? How much
money did she have in her purse?</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy thought it was about ten dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ten dollars could take that girl a long way,”
the officer said significantly. “What about
publicity on the case? We broadcast a general
alarm for missing persons every evening over
the radio.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Undecided, the girls appealed to Dale.
“What do you think?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s another day. If she’s not home by
then, by all means, yes. Anything to find her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll do our best for you. I’ll assign the
case to the Detective Bureau right away, but be
sure and telephone at once when she comes
home. And take my word for it, she’ll show up
before morning,” the sergeant prophesied as
they turned to go.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He probably thinks she’s only out on a
party,” Pauline said later.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But he doesn’t know Irene,” Judy reminded
her. “She’s not the kind of girl police officers
are used to dealing with.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>“You bet she isn’t,” Dale agreed fervently.
He promised to be back as soon as it was daylight
and urged the girls to try and get a little
rest in the meantime. Judy surprised him a
few hours later by announcing that she intended
to spend the day at the office.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Emily Grimshaw may know something
about this,” she explained. “At least I intend
to find out all there is to know about this Joy
Holiday person. If there really is someone
who looks exactly like Irene it might get her
into a good deal of trouble.”</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>THE IMMORTAL JOY HOLIDAY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“That’s a good idea of yours,” Dale told
Judy just before she left to go to the office.
“Have a nice long talk with Her Majesty and
I’ll meet you at noon to see what she says.
In the meantime I’ll make some more inquiries
at the bookstore and of people in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, and you might tell them at the police
station that we gave a wrong description of
Irene’s clothes,” Pauline called out to them.
She had just been to the closet for her hat
and school books and had discovered Irene’s
brown suit hanging there. Only the yellow
dress and jacket were missing from her wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was the same yellow dress that she wore
to the dance,” Judy explained.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>“And she wore it that day I discovered you
in the office,” Dale remembered. “She certainly
looked like the heroine of our popular
song then. Do you suppose there is a chance
that <i>Golden Girl</i> was written for her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Both girls laughed. “Dale Meredith! How
absurd! It was written twenty years ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But when Emily Grimshaw heard of Irene’s
disappearance and made a similar suggestion
Judy took it more seriously. She strained her
ears to hear every word the agent said as she
rocked back and forth in her swivel chair. Apparently
she was talking to herself—something
about the spirit world and Joy’s song over the
radio.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” she went on in a louder tone, “those
poems were written for Joy, every last one of
them, and she sat right on that sofa while I
read <i>Golden Girl</i> aloud. That was twenty years
ago. Then all of a sudden I see her again after
I think she’s dead—same starry eyes, same
golden hair, everything the same, even to her
dress. Then her mother’s poems turn up
missing——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So the poet was Joy Holiday’s mother!”
Judy interrupted to exclaim.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless you, yes,” her employer returned.
“I thought you knew. She went stark crazy.
Set fire to her own house and tried to burn herself
alive.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>“Who did? The poet? How terrible!” Judy
cried, starting from her chair. “Why, it
seems impossible that I’ve been correcting a
crazy woman’s verses without even knowing it.
Tower of flame, indeed! So that’s what she
meant!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Emily Grimshaw laughed dryly. “Don’t ask
me what she meant! I’m no authority on crazy
people. The asylum’s the place for them, and,
if it weren’t for that mercenary brother of
hers, Sarah Glenn would be there yet. He arranged
for her release and managed to get himself
appointed as her guardian. Handles all of
her finances, you see, and takes care of the
estate. The poet’s pretty much of a recluse. I
haven’t seen her for years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was beginning to sound more like sense.
Hopefully, Judy ventured, “But you have seen
her daughter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seen her! Seen her!” she cried. “That’s
just it. I see her in my dreams. Ordinarily
people don’t see spirits and that’s why it gave
me such a turn the other day. And Joy did
come back! Her mother said so in the last
poem she ever wrote. Jasper brought it in only
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>“He did!” Judy exclaimed. “What did you
tell him about the missing poetry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing. And I intend to tell him nothing.
If it becomes necessary to tell anyone we’ll tell
the poet herself. Her address is on this envelope.
Keep it, Miss Bolton, you may need it.
The poem I mentioned is on the other side.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy turned it over and read:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>As far as Judy was concerned, the conversation
closed right there. She had learned nothing
of importance. In fact, she had learned
nothing at all except that her employer believed
in spirits. Someone, twenty years ago, had
probably looked like Irene. But that wouldn’t
help find Irene now.</p>

    <div>FALSE ASSURANCE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>At noon Judy gave Dale and Pauline what
little information she had over sandwiches and
coffee in a near-by restaurant. Joy Holiday,
she told them, disappeared twenty years ago;
and Emily Grimshaw’s only reason for acting
strangely was because she believed Irene to be
her ghost.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If that’s the case,” Dale declared, “we’re
simply wasting time questioning her. Irene’s
father might know something real.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy agreed. They telegraphed him at once:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='fss'>IRENE MISSING SINCE YESTERDAY STOP IS SHE</span></div>

      <div class='line in29'><span class='fss'>JUDY</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The answer came back early that same afternoon:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='fss'>DONT WORRY STOP IRENE WITH RELATIVES IN</span></div>

      <div class='line in28'><span class='fss'>TOM LANG</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>Relief flooded Judy’s face. She waved the
telegram excitedly and was on the point of telling
the news to Emily Grimshaw. Then she decided
that she had better not—not yet, at any
rate. The papers were still missing even if
Irene was safe. It would be better to clear her
chum of all suspicion as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Freed of a measure of worry and suspense,
Judy’s mind eagerly took up the story of Joy
Holiday’s strange disappearance. Now that she
felt sure it had nothing to do with Irene she
could view the tale dispassionately and take it
for what it was worth. Still holding to Dale
Meredith’s theory that valuable clues might be
found in the poetry, she questioned Emily Grimshaw.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why do you call the girl Joy Holiday when
her mother’s name was Glenn?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s only a pen name.” The agent explained.
“Not any prettier than Holiday, is
it? But when she had her first poems published
Sarah was so anxious to please the publishers
that she agreed to use a name that was short
enough to be printed across the back of that
thin little book. Humph! And now the publishers
are just as anxious to please her!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“What happened to her husband?” Judy
asked after a pause.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dick Holiday? He left her shortly after
their baby was born. Said he’d married a
wife, not a nursemaid, and she insisted upon
giving all of her time to Joy. When the child
finally made a few friends among young folks
her own age her mother, in a fit of jealous rage,
locked her in the tower.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What tower?” Judy asked, growing more
and more interested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a circular tower built onto Sarah’s
house. Joy’s room was on the third floor and
there’s where her mother locked her up. She
wanted Joy all to herself. That’s what I call
mothering a girl to death. Though how Joy
died is still something of a puzzle to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why? What happened to her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Emily Grimshaw’s expression changed. The
lines in her forehead deepened. “I told you she
disappeared, vanished completely, just like you
say this friend of yours vanished. Some folks
think she jumped from a window. How ever it
happened, Jasper Crosby identified a body in
the morgue as hers. They had a funeral over
it and buried it, but her mother declares to this
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>day it wasn’t Joy. It didn’t look like her. That
girl was too beautiful to die and Sarah thinks
she floats around bodily, mind you. No doubt
you gathered that much from reading the
poetry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” Judy exclaimed. “That....”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, <i>that</i>. But I doubt it.” She shook her
head gravely and regarded Judy with a fixed
stare. “Yes, I very much doubt it. Joy Holiday
must be dead. Otherwise her spirit
wouldn’t be coming back to haunt the earth.
But what I’ve done that she should haunt me,
the good Lord knows!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Published the poetry, perhaps,” Judy suggested
wickedly. If Irene’s disappearance
hadn’t been such a serious matter she would
have laughed at the old lady’s superstitions.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the way home Judy tried to figure out why
Irene had failed to get in touch with her. That
Blackberry had chewed up her note as well as
the yellow flower petals seemed likely until she
talked it over with Pauline.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A cat chew up paper?” the other girl
sniffed. “Why, Judy, only goats do that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know, but Blackberry is an unusual cat.
I thought he might——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>“Well, he wouldn’t,” Pauline interrupted.
“You know, yourself, Irene is sometimes
thoughtless. She probably didn’t leave any
note. She never breathed a word about those
relatives either, and I think she must have had
some reason for not wanting us to know where
she was going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy nodded, unconvinced. Irene wasn’t
that sort. The relatives in Brooklyn might
have been a surprise to her also. Judy remembered
distinctly Irene’s assertion that she
didn’t know a soul in the city. Her father must
have revealed some family history in his letter.
Oh, why did telegrams need to be so brief?</p>

<p class='c005'>Vaguely uneasy about the whole affair, Judy
showed the telegram to Dale when he called
later in the evening. As he read it his face
beamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What more do you want?” he cried. “She’s
safe! It’s all of Heaven to know that much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In a little while everything would be explained.
Irene hadn’t intended to worry them.
And Dale was right. They should forget everything
else and simply be thankful that she was
safe.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>For a week Judy went about the daily office
routine cheered by the hope that Irene would
soon come back. After that doubts began to
crowd in. Dale had been calling regularly,
helping Pauline entertain even if there remained
only one guest to pilot through the
never-ending wonders of the world’s greatest
city. One evening when he called to take them
to dinner Judy confided her fears to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t trust that telegram,” she said in a
low voice. “If Irene really is safe why hasn’t
she written to tell us where she is?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve been wondering about that for a
week,” Dale replied. “Suppose we send another
telegram.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And have it answered as briefly as the last
one? No,” Judy declared emphatically. “I’m
going to find out what has happened if it costs
my week’s salary in nickels. Where’s the nearest
phone booth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale pointed out a cigar store at the next
corner and escorted her to it. Together she
and Pauline assembled quite a pile of coins and
Judy dropped her first nickel in the slot. It
was a relief to hear a nurse’s voice, finally, at
the other end of the wire.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>“Farringdon Sanitarium?” she asked. “Is
Mr. Lang well enough to come to the phone?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes indeed,” the voice replied. “Just
a moment and I will call him. He is taking a
walk around the grounds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s taking a walk,” Judy turned and whispered.
“Won’t Irene be glad to hear he’s out
of his wheeled chair?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Mr. Lang’s voice, wonderfully clear,
asked who was calling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s Judy. I called about Irene.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About Irene!” Instantly the voice changed.
Judy could tell that her fears were well
founded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes. About Irene. She’s still missing.
Who are her relatives in Brooklyn?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, I—I dunno,” the old man faltered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t know! But you said not to
worry. She was with relatives....”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t I say as she might be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you <i>didn’t</i> know where she was?”
Judy demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“N-no, not for sure. She’d have a purty
hard time findin’ abody from jest the looks of
their house. But she does have relatives—if
they ain’t dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her mother’s relatives?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>“Yes, my poor Annie’s folks. I told her
about them in a letter, but I get all muddled up
on the names. Can’t seem to remember. It’s
queer how anything like that slips a man’s
mind. Can’t you help me, Judy?” he begged.
“Ain’t there anything you can do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s <i>every</i>thing. Why, we would have
turned New York inside out looking for her if
it hadn’t been for that telegram——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale touched her arm. “Go easy, Judy. Her
father’s upset, too. Better hang up, and we’ll
report it to the police again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time Mr. Lang was saying, “I’ll
manage it somehow. The nurses ain’t strong
enough to keep me here when my little girl is
lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Through tear-dimmed eyes, Judy fumbled
for the pile of coins, put the few that were left
back in her pocketbook and stumbled out of the
store with Dale and Pauline.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All this to go through again,” she moaned,
“and after we believed she was safe!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she looked up and saw Dale’s sober
face and resolved to be brave herself.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>“We’re going to the police station, aren’t
we?” she asked. “We’ll tell them it was a mistake—that
report that she was with relatives—and
perhaps, if we hurry, there will still be
time for a police broadcast of Irene’s description
over the radio tonight!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There must be time,” Dale said between set
lips. “And then what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then,” Judy declared, “we’re going to
take paper and pencil and write down every
possible thing that could have happened to
Irene. After that we’re going to begin with the
most plausible and follow up every clue. We’ll
call in the police where necessary but we are
the ones to do the brain work. We are the ones
who care.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>OVER THE RADIO</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Lieutenant Collins was a big man with a
ruddy face and blue eyes that smiled kindly
over his massive desk. Like Chief Kelly at
home he inspired confidence, and Judy felt relieved
to be talking with him instead of the
young sergeant they had found at the police
station before. With now and then an additional
bit of information from Dale and Pauline,
she retold the story of Irene’s mysterious
disappearance. Then she explained Mr. Lang’s
subsequent telegram leading them to suppose
Irene was safe and, finally, the discovery that
Mr. Lang had merely described a house in
Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see, he lives in a small town. He didn’t
realize that such a description would be of no
use to Irene here. And now,” Judy finished,
“we seem to be right back where we started
from—without a clue.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>By this time quite a group of officers and
young detectives had gathered around the
lieutenant’s desk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s beginning to look like an interesting
case,” one of them remarked with a smug satisfaction
that caused Dale to glare at him.
Irene was no case! She was a flesh-and-blood
girl—lost, alone. He did not think of the many
instances in his own stories where the detective
had made similar remarks. It never occurred
to him that here was real experience on which
to build his imaginative tales. No one had told
him that the one thing his stories lacked was
an intensity of feeling gained only by living
through an actual tragedy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy thought of it. It seemed irrelevant,
almost disloyal to Irene to think of fiction and
Dale’s future just then. But if they found
Irene, Dale’s future might be hers. How wonderful!
And after those high-hat girls in Farringdon
had snubbed her so! It would be almost
a triumph for Judy, too—that is, if they
could only find Irene and give this Cinderella
story a chance to come true.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>The printed form Judy had previously filled
in was still on file in the police records. This
was checked up and once more turned over to
the Detective Bureau. The description, Lieutenant
Collins promised, would be telephoned
to the Bureau of Missing Persons and broadcast
over the radio at seven-thirty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale looked at his watch. Only an hour and
the whole country would be hearing about
Irene’s disappearance. Surely someone had
seen her, and whoever it was couldn’t forget
the golden dress and slippers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Girls don’t vanish,” Judy declared as they
turned to leave.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, but they do,” Pauline cried. “Joy
Holiday vanished right out of a locked room.
And when they found her she was dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>None of them spoke after that. Automatically
they went back to the house and climbed
up the three long flights of stairs. Blackberry
greeted them as they opened the door, but Judy
had no heart for romping with him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go away!” she said, pushing him gently
out of the way. “Cats can’t understand human
troubles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But instead of minding her, he rubbed his
silky head against her ankles. His soft, crackly
purr seemed to say: “Cats do understand human
troubles. What you need is someone who
loves you to sympathize.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>Tears came to Judy’s eyes. She thought of
her father and mother struggling with an epidemic
of influenza when they had wanted a
vacation. She thought of her brother, Horace.
She thought of Peter and Honey and their two
dear grandparents, of Arthur who had once
helped hunt for Lorraine Lee in his airplane.
How she missed them all! How she needed
them! Oh, why had she and Irene ever left
Farringdon at all? To find adventure, she supposed.
Now she felt sick to death of adventure
and only wanted all her friends together the
way they used to be. Irene, even the pale overworked
Irene, would be better than this awful
uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Walking over to the radio, Judy stood watching
Dale as he fumbled with the dials. In ten
more minutes the police alarms would be on
the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A little more to the left if you want the city
station,” Pauline directed from her chair beside
the desk. He turned the dials and, loud
and clear, a familiar dance tune broke upon
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>their senses. It was <i>Golden Girl</i> and a well-known
radio artist, Kate South, was singing in
an emotional, contralto voice:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My own golden girl. There is one, only one</div>
      <div class='line'>Who has eyes like the stars and hair like the sun.</div>
      <div class='line'>In your new yellow gown you’re a dream of delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>You have danced in my heart on bright slippers tonight ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Judy bowed her head and tears smarted in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene’s description,” Dale said fiercely.
He shut off the radio and did not turn it on
again until the ten minutes were up.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gongs sounded and then the announcer’s
voice, very cold and matter-of-fact, read
through the list of missing persons. Irene’s
name came last:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='fss'>MISSING SINCE JUNE TWENTIETH: IRENE LANG</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>That was all. In a few seconds it was over
and Judy was left with the sick feeling that no
one had heard.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c005'>In the living room of their little apartment
two hundred miles away, Mrs. Dobbs settled
herself in a comfortable rocker ready to relax
and listen to the radio. Mrs. Dobbs loved music.
Usually she listened to the old-time melodies
but there was something especially appealing
about the popular song that Kate South was
singing. She called to her grandson.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come here, Peter, and listen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The tall youth entered the room and
stretched himself in a chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gee, Grandma! It makes a fellow feel lonesome.
Why the dickens do you suppose Judy
had to spend her vacation so far away from
folks who care about her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s with Irene,” Mrs. Dobbs replied,
“and from what I hear, Pauline Faulkner has
taken a great liking to both of them. Honey
was saying only this morning that she wished
she’d been invited, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>“I’m glad she wasn’t,” Peter returned with
vigor. “At least I have a little to say about
what my sister is and isn’t going to do. Where
is she now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out with Horace. He’s been taking her out
alone since Irene went away——”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mrs. Dobbs stopped speaking as Peter
held up his hand. The music had played out
and neither of them had been paying much attention
to the announcements that followed until
the name, Irene Lang, broke upon their
senses. Missing, was she?</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter gave a low whistle of surprise and then
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are you going?” his grandmother
cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Going to get the car,” he flung over his
shoulder. “Judy will be needing me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the hallway he bumped into Horace and
Honey just returning from a short walk
through town.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s the fire?” Horace greeted him.
“If there’s something exciting going on I want
to hear about it. The paper’s starving for
news.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>“Irene Lang has disappeared!” Peter gave
out the “news” so suddenly that Horace was
dumbfounded for a moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I’m going to New York to help Judy,”
he added. “She’s apt to go too far with her
flare for detecting. You might as well come,
too. Maybe the paper will finance the trip if
we bring back a big scoop——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sa-ay!” Horace broke in. “Don’t forget
it’s Irene Lang who is missing. News or no
news, nothing goes into the paper that isn’t
on the level.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t I know it!” Peter replied. “Irene
wouldn’t do anything that wasn’t on the level
and there’s Judy to consider, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want to help,” Honey spoke up. “Won’t
you let me come with you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horace looked at her and shook his head.
The trip wouldn’t be a very safe one with Peter
in his present mood and his car capable of a
speed exceeding sixty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then can’t we do something here?” she
begged. “Can’t we go and see Irene’s father?
Maybe he knows where she went.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh!” Horace exclaimed. “That’s a real
idea, Honey. You’ll be as good as Judy if you
keep on using those little gray cells of yours.
Goodbye, Peter! We’re off for the sanitarium.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>“Backing out, eh?” Peter gibed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Backing out, nothing! If we learn anything
important,” Horace declared, “we can
beat your car in Arthur’s airplane.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>THE ONLY ANSWER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And yet Judy felt that no one had heard, that
it was all up to her. Even Dale Meredith seemed
not to be helping, and Pauline.... How much
did Pauline care? Neither of them had attempted
to follow Judy’s suggestion that they
write down every possible clue. Instead they
talked—talked until midnight, almost—when
she was trying so hard to think.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Mary came in. Mary usually came in
when Pauline stayed up too late. The cocoa
that she served was a signal for Dale to leave
and the girls to retire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline drank her cocoa quickly and walked
with him to the door. When it closed behind
him she still stood there, her head pressed
against the panels.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re tired,” Judy told her. “I’ll take
this cocoa into my room and let you sleep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aren’t you going to drink it?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>Judy shook her head. “Not with Irene gone.
It would make me sleepy too, and I’ve simply
got to think.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alone in her room she tried to turn herself
into an abstract thing, a mental machine that
could think without feeling. In her heart she
could not believe Irene had taken the poetry,
but in her mind she knew that it must be so.</p>

<p class='c005'>Didn’t Irene want the poems because they
described a house? Even the address might
have been among the conglomeration of papers.
When her father suggested that she visit relatives
in Brooklyn he had described a house also.
Perhaps the two descriptions were the same.
Perhaps the relative she sought was Sarah
Glenn! For surely it was more than coincidence
that Irene looked so much like the poet’s
daughter, Joy Holiday. Could she have been
an aunt? No, because Sarah Glenn had only
the one child. A distant cousin? Hardly.
Then there was only one conclusion left: Joy
Holiday might have been Irene’s own mother!</p>

<p class='c005'>Could Irene have put two and two together,
just as Judy was doing, and gone to the poet’s
house the day she disappeared? No doubt, if
she did, she planned to be back again before
either Judy or Pauline returned. Something
had prevented her!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>That something might have been Jasper
Crosby, cruel, scheming, mercenary creature
that he was. Or it might have been poor, demented
Sarah Glenn. She might have locked
Irene in the tower the way she had once locked
her own daughter away from her friends.
There was no telling what a crazy woman
might do!</p>

<p class='c005'>An hour later Judy still sat on her bed, trying
to decide what to do. Her cocoa, on a forgotten
corner of the dresser, had crusted over
like cold paste. She rose, walked across the
room, tasted the cold drink and set down the
cup. She must come to some decision! Irene
might be living through a nightmare of torture
in that horrible house Sarah Glenn had described
in her poems.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the next room Pauline was sleeping
soundly. Judy could wake her, ask her advice.
Downstairs the telephone waited ready to help
her. She could call Lieutenant Collins at the
police station and tell her findings to him. She
could telephone Mr. Lang again and ask him
more questions—worry him more. She could
call the young author, Dale Meredith.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>Yes, she could call Dale and tell him that the
insane poet might be Irene’s grandmother; that
the scheming miser, Jasper Crosby, might be
her uncle and that Irene, herself, had probably
stolen the poetry to help locate them. What a
shock that would be to the young author who
had idolized Irene and called her his Golden
Girl. Judy hadn’t the heart to disillusion him
although her own spirit was heavy with the
hurt of it all.</p>

<p class='c005'>She wouldn’t notify the police either. Irene
must not be subjected to an unkind cross fire of
questions when, or if, she did return. Judy
would find Irene herself and let her explain.
Suppose she had stolen the poetry? What
did it matter? Judy was learning not to expect
perfection in people. She would love Irene all
the more, forgiving her. And if Irene had
stolen the poetry she could give it back quietly,
and Judy could explain things to Emily Grimshaw.
Dale need never be told.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy wouldn’t have done that much to shield
herself. She could.... Oh, now she knew she
could stand shock, excitement, tragedy. But
it wouldn’t do to have people blaming Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>That night Judy buried her head in the pillows
waiting, wide-eyed, for morning. Morning
would tell. She knew that work was slack
at the office and that Emily Grimshaw often did
not come in until afternoon. She would take the
morning off and go ... she consulted the bit
of paper with the poet’s latest verse on one side
and her address scribbled on the other. She
got up out of bed to take it from her pocketbook
and study it. The street apparently had
no name.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>One blk. past Parkville, just off Gravesend
Avenue.</i></p>

  <h2 id='chap18' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>IN THE TOWER WINDOW</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Morning dawned cold and misty. Judy
fumbled through the closet hunting for an umbrella,
and her trembling fingers touched Irene’s
clothes. They lingered lovingly in the folds of
each well remembered dress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene! Irene!” she thought. “I don’t care
what you’ve done if only I can bring you back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the adjoining room Pauline was still
asleep. How cruel of her to sleep! No one was
up except Blackberry, out there on the roof
garden. Feeling that she must say goodbye
to somebody, Judy whispered it to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was too early for the throng of office
workers to be abroad when Judy stepped out
on the wet pavement and turned toward the subway
entrance. The tall buildings in lower New
York were little more than shadows, and the
clock in the Metropolitan Tower was veiled in
mist. Ghostly halos were around all the street
lamps, and dampness seemed to have settled
heavily over everything.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>Judy felt it. The only comforting thing about
the trip was the fact that she would be riding
on the subway alone for the first time. She
paid her fare, asked a few directions, and soon
was seated in an express train bound for
Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c005'>She pressed her forehead against the window
as the train came onto Manhattan Bridge and
started its trip over the East River. Freighters
steamed down toward the ocean and up again.
Everything looked gray.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she watched, Judy’s hopes sank lower and
lower. She began to realize that it was not the
part of wisdom to go on her dangerous errand
to the poet’s house alone. What would she
say if Jasper Crosby opened the door? Would
her experience with eccentric Emily Grimshaw
help her to cope with the insane hallucinations
of Sarah Glenn? Would she dare demand to
know what had happened to Irene when a possibility
existed that they had never seen her?
Suppose they asked for the missing poetry. If
she lied to defend Irene her nervousness might
betray her. Judy knew that her chances of
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>finding her chum were slim, very slim. Like
the shining tracks behind her they seemed to
lessen as the train sped on.</p>

<p class='c005'>At Ninth Avenue she changed to the Culver
Line. Up came the train, out of the tunnel, and
the wet gray walls at the side of the tracks grew
lower and lower. Soon they were clear of the
ground and Judy realized that this was the
elevated. Only four more stations! She looked
around, eager for her first glimpse of Brooklyn,
but what she saw caused her to shudder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ugh! A graveyard.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It stretched on and on, a grim sight on that
dreary morning. Even after the white stones
were left behind vacant lots and empty buildings
made the scene look almost as cheerless.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the fourth stop Judy got off and went
down to the street. It was silly, but the thought
came to her that if ever spirits walked abroad
they would walk along Gravesend Avenue.</p>

<p class='c005'>Consulting the slip of paper, she counted
blocks as she passed them and watched for
Parkville Avenue. She knew the old-fashioned
street at once from the quaint houses that lined
it. Then came the Long Island Railroad cut
with a long line of box cars passing under
Gravesend Avenue in a slow-moving procession.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>She paused. Could the alley beyond be the
street she sought? No wonder they hadn’t
named it anything. Why, it wasn’t even paved!
It seemed little more than a trail through
vacant lots. She hesitated, looked ahead and
caught her breath in a quick, terrified gasp.
Then she stared, open-mouthed. There was
something sinister about the huge, gray frame
building that loomed in her path. The gnarled
old trees surrounding it seemed almost alive,
and the wind whistling through their branches
sounded like a warning. But it was the tower,
not the house itself, that caused Judy to gasp.
The whole lower part of it was burned away
and in the tower window something thin and
yellow moved back and forth behind the curtains.
It looked like an elongated ghost!</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy rubbed her eyes and looked again. This
time the tower was dark with the even blackness
of drawn shades behind closed windows.</p>

<p class='c005'>An unreasonable fear took possession of the
watching girl. She felt that she had seen something
not there in material substance. Stanza
after stanza of Sarah Glenn’s poetry forced itself
upon her consciousness, and it all fitted
this house—the yellow ghost in the window, the
crumbling tower.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>Suddenly Judy realized that she was standing
stock-still in the middle of the muddy unpaved
street, moving her lips and making no
sound. She was doing the same thing that
Emily Grimshaw had done when Dale Meredith
said she was crazy. Oh! She must get control
of herself, take herself in hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If the house can frighten me like this,” she
thought, “what wouldn’t it do to Irene?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bracing her slim shoulders and mustering all
her courage, Judy marched up on the porch and
felt for the bell. Finding none, she rapped with
her bare knuckles. The sound of her rap sent
an echo reverberating through the walls of the
still house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy waited. She waited a long time before
she dared rap again. The house seemed to be
inhabited only by the echo she had heard and
the phantom that had vanished from the tower
window.</p>

<p class='c005'>Still nobody answered. Judy tried the door
and found it locked. Then she peered through
the lower windows and saw at once that the
house was empty of furniture.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>“Nobody lives here,” she told herself and
then she told herself the same thing all over
again so that it would surely seem true. “Nobody
ever does live in empty houses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet she had the strangest feeling that she
was being watched!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>LIKE A FAIRY TALE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Her nerves taxed to the breaking point, Judy
gave up searching for the day and went to the
office. Emily Grimshaw was not there but she
had left a message:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Will be away for a time and leave you in
charge.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>“Me in charge!” Judy exclaimed. She
couldn’t imagine herself conducting Emily
Grimshaw’s business sensibly. “I’ll just close
up for the day,” she decided in exasperation.
Leaving a notice to that effect at the hotel desk,
she locked the office and started for Dr. Faulkner’s
house.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the entrance hall she was met by an anxious
group of faces. Dale’s, Pauline’s—and
Peter’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Judy!” he cried, and then when her only
answer was a choked sob, again, “Judy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Peter! You’ll help?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>“That’s why I’m here. We telephoned
<i>every</i>where. We thought you’d never come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where on earth were you?” Dale asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hunting for Irene,” Judy explained
brokenly. “I—I followed up a clue. I thought
I knew where Irene was and I went out there to
get her to—to bring her home and surprise you,
but she wasn’t there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wasn’t <i>where</i>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where I thought she was ... the most
awful place just off Gravesend Avenue out in
old Parkville. The—the house has a tower,
just like the tower in Sarah Glenn’s poems. It’s
burned halfway up and—and—and——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what, Judy? Don’t act so frightened.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There was something in the tower,” she
blurted out, “something yellow——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Probably a yellow dog or some such ordinary
thing,” Pauline interrupted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, but it wasn’t! I saw it as plainly as
anything, and it looked like a woman in a yellow
robe, only she was too tall and too thin to be
real. Then I looked again and she was gone
but I could still feel her watching me. It was
awful! I didn’t think there could be a tower
of flame or a ghost, but there they were!” Judy
leaned back against the closed door and threw
both hands outward in a gesture of bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>“And I always thought I was a practical
person. I always trusted my own head—and
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Impulsively, Peter caught her hands in his.
His voice was husky. “I still trust them, Judy.
Tell me everything,” he pleaded. “I know you
must have had a good reason for thinking that
Irene might be in this queer old house. Why
did you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because Irene looks so much like the poet’s
daughter, Joy Holiday. I thought they might
be related. Mr. Lang spoke of Irene’s relatives.
He told her to look them up. But the
poet is crazy! Anything might happen!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet you went there alone!” Peter exclaimed.
“Don’t you realize that whatever happened
to Irene might have happened to you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did realize it—when I got there,” Judy
faltered. “I—I guess I wasn’t very brave to
run away, but nobody seemed to live in the
house. It looked—empty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, of course, Irene couldn’t be there,”
Pauline concluded.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>“Oh, but they might have moved—<i>and taken
her with them</i>!” Judy turned to Peter, a new
fear in her eyes. “You know about law. Tell
me, if Irene is related to Sarah Glenn wouldn’t
she inherit some of her property?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That depends upon the will,” he replied.
“If she made a will before she went insane——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She did!” Judy interrupted. “She willed
the property to her daughter and, in the event
of her death, it was to go to her brother, Jasper
Crosby. He’s a crook and a scoundrel,”
she declared, “worse than Slippery McQuirk or
any of Vine Thompson’s gang, if I’m any judge
of character. You see, if Irene is related to the
poet through Joy Holiday, how convenient it
would be for him to have her out of the way?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean that Joy Holiday might have
been Irene’s mother?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She couldn’t have been,” Pauline spoke up.
“Joy Holiday has been dead for twenty years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Supposedly! Her mother never did believe
the body was hers, and even Emily Grimshaw
says it didn’t look like her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’d they get the body?” Peter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>“Jasper Crosby went to the morgue and got
it. He identified it as Joy’s, and people paid
no attention to his sister’s objections because
they knew she was insane.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then this girl, Joy Holiday, is legally dead.
But if we can prove that there has been a
fraud....”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What fraud?” Dale questioned. “You
don’t mean to tell us that this Jasper Crosby
may have falsely identified some unknown girl’s
body in order to inherit his sister’s property?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s exactly what I was trying to say. I
don’t know anything about Irene’s mother and
neither does she. Mr. Lang only remembered
the name, Annie, and that, as well as Joy, may
have been only a nickname.” Judy turned to
Peter. “I know how you felt when your
parents were a mystery. Well, wouldn’t Irene
feel the same way? Her father gave away
some family history in his letter, and Irene was
more impressed than we know by Emily Grimshaw’s
collapse. Remember, I wrote you about
it, Peter? She wanted to find out about her
mother——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then she did take the poetry,” Pauline
put in.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>“Yes,” Judy agreed. “I’m afraid she did.
It’s a terrible thing not to know the truth about
one’s parents, and Irene must have taken the
poetry to help her find that horrible house that
seems to have swallowed her up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She said she didn’t,” Dale maintained.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy felt suddenly ashamed that his trust in
Irene should be greater than hers. But if, distrusting
her, Judy found her, then she could be
glad of her disbelief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is another possibility,” she ventured
and made her voice sound more hopeful than
she felt. “There is the possibility that Irene
may be safe in the poet’s house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That sounds more plausible,” Dale agreed,
“but you said the house was empty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said it <i>looked</i> empty, except for that unearthly
thing in the tower. But, now that I
think of it, something alive must have been
there to pull the shades. Do you suppose,”
Judy asked in a tremulous whisper, “that somebody
could be locked there like Joy Holiday
was when she vanished?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It sounds like a fairy tale, doesn’t it? But
not,” Peter added gravely, “if Irene is in the
tower. Judy, we must do something—and do it
quickly.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>It did not take him long to decide what that
something would be. “We’ll get a policeman
to go with us,” he declared. “The police have
a right to force their way into a house if nobody
answers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Without a search warrant?” questioned
Pauline.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s the dickens of it,” Dale fumed.
“There’s sure to be some red tape attached to
it and loss of time may mean—loss of Irene.
We’ve got to convince the police that this is a
matter of life and death!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A taxi was the quickest means of getting to
the police station. It took considerable explaining,
however, to convince officials that the case
was urgent. The fact that the owner of the
house was known to be insane and that Irene
might be held there against her will proved to
be the strongest argument in favor of the search
warrant they requested. But it could not be
served until the following day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have to go before a magistrate,” Lieutenant
Collins explained, “and night warrants
are allowed only in cases where persons or
property are positively known to be in the
place to be searched. However, there are several
ways of getting around that. If a felony
has been committed, as in the present case, we
don’t need a warrant.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>“What felony?” Judy asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great guns!” he exclaimed. “Don’t you
call kidnaping a felony? If the girl’s held
there against her will it’s a plain case of kidnaping!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy hadn’t thought of that. Kidnapers
and killers were almost synonymous in her
mind and the thought was terrifying.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lieutenant Collins wasted no further time
but called the Parkville Precinct, and two
policemen were detailed to meet Judy, Pauline,
Dale and Peter and accompany them to the
house with the crumbling tower.</p>

    <div>THE SCENT OF ROSES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Neither Peter nor Dale stopped to count the
cost of taxicabs that night. The driver hesitated
only a moment. Their request that he
make the fastest possible time to the distant
Brooklyn police station was not a usual one.
Knowing that it must be urgent, the driver
made good his promise and soon they were
speeding across Manhattan Bridge, through
side streets in reckless haste and then down
the long stretch of boulevard. Judy leaned
out of the window and searched the scene ahead
for a trace of anything familiar.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ocean Parkway, lined with its modern dwelling
houses and new apartment buildings was
as unlike Gravesend Avenue as anything could
be. Still, the two were only a few blocks apart.
The driver turned his cab down a side street,
sure of his bearings; and Judy, watching, saw
the sudden change. The boulevard with its
lights and stream of traffic, then queer old
Parkville, a village forgotten while Brooklyn
grew up around it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>The police station looked all the more imposing
in this setting. Two young policemen were
already there, waiting beside the high desk and
talking with the captain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sarah Glenn’s house was only a short distance
away, and together they walked it. Soon
they were turning down the unpaved end of the
street that bordered the railroad cut.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There it is!” Judy shivered a little and
drew her coat closer as she pointed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The house was dark and silent. The windows
were black—black with an unfathomable blackness
that must be within. Peter sensed Judy’s
fear for he took her arm and guided her as
they came up the broken walk.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the steps Dale stopped and picked up a
white flower.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What can it mean?” Pauline whispered.
“How would a rose get here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He shook his head. “It’s beyond me. What’s
this?” He fingered a lavender ribbon that was
still attached to the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looks as if there’d been a funeral here,”
one of the police officers observed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>Both girls stood trembling as he banged and
pounded on the door and then shouted a threat
to the still house.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody home,” he turned and said. “Do
you think it’s necessary to force our way in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“More than ever,” Judy replied. “We <i>must</i>
see what’s in the tower!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Okay! Give me a hand, partner, and we’ll
smash the door.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Underneath the porch they found a beam
which would serve their purpose. Peter and
Dale helped the policemen, and soon the heavy
door gave way and crashed into the empty
house. A sickening, musty smell combined with
the heady odor of flowers greeted them as they
stepped inside.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A funeral all right!” the policeman reiterated.
“Get the perfume, don’t you? But
everything’s cleared up—except....” He and
Judy had seen it at the same time but the
policeman was the first to pick it up. “... this
card.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me see it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Obligingly he handed it to the girl. She
turned it over in her hand and passed it on to
Dale. It read:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span><i>With deepest sympathy</i></div>
    <div><i>Emily Grimshaw</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know the party?” the other officer
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My employer,” Judy replied simply.</p>

<p class='c005'>The question in her mind, however, was less
easily answered. Was Emily Grimshaw’s absence
from her office explainable by this death?
Whose death? If Emily Grimshaw had sent
flowers certainly she must know.</p>

<p class='c005'>The policemen were busy searching the
house, and Judy and her three companions followed
them. The rooms upstairs, like those on
the first floor, were empty of furniture. But
the tower room was found to open from a third
floor bedroom. To their surprise, this room
was completely furnished, even to bed coverings
and pillows. A little kitchen adjoined it
and there were evidences that food had recently
been cooked there. An extra cot was made up
in the hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the poet and her brother had lived in their
immense house and occupied only two rooms!
Or three? They had yet to explore the tower.
Peter Dobbs tried the door and found it locked.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>“We’ll have to break this one, too,” the
policemen said, and Dale offered to get the
beam.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline’s hand kept him. “Wait a minute,”
she pleaded. “It’s a shame to spoil the door
and maybe this key will fit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She took a queer brass key from her hand
bag. Judy and Peter frankly stared. The
policemen, though obviously doubting its usefulness,
consented to try it. To their astonishment,
it turned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where did you find that key?” Dale questioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the pocket of Irene’s brown suit. I put
it in my own hand bag for safe-keeping.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rather suspected it fitted something, didn’t
you?” he said sarcastically. “Well, to me it
doesn’t prove a thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does to me,” Judy put in, “although not
what you think. This must have been Joy Holiday’s
room when she was a child! And if
Irene had the key surely Joy Holiday is related
to her—perhaps her own mother!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It sounds like pretty sound figuring to me,”’
Peter agreed, flashing a look of boyish admiration
in Judy’s direction.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>Then, as the door swung open, they followed
the policemen into the tower. Peter pushed a
button and the light revealed a circular room
with a gay panorama of nursery rhyme characters
frolicking across the wall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon closer inspection, however, the room
was seen to be six-sided with shelves built into
two of its corners. On one of these dolls and
expensive toys were neatly arranged. Books
and games for a somewhat older girl adorned
the other shelf.</p>

<p class='c005'>A curtained wardrobe concealed another corner,
while a white cot bed, all freshly made, occupied
the corner at the left of the door. The
two remaining corners were cleverly camouflaged
by concave mirrors with uneven distorting
surfaces, such as are sometimes seen in
amusement park funny houses. In spite of
Judy’s anxiety, she could not suppress a smile
when the two policemen walked by them.</p>

<p class='c005'>So this was the room where the poet had
locked Joy Holiday! Did she think those silly
mirrors and a roomful of books and toys could
make up for a lack of freedom? Judy, who
had always been allowed to choose what friends
she liked, could easily see why the poet’s daughter
had wanted to run away—or vanish as people
said she had done. How strange it all was
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>and how thrilling to be standing in the very
room where Irene’s mother had stood twenty
years before!</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s so quiet and peaceful here,” Judy said.
“Nothing very terrible could have happened in
this pretty room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had momentarily forgotten that the whole
lower structure of it had been burned away,
that she had seen a tall yellow specter peering
out of its window.</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter, however, remembered the fantastic
story Judy had told him. It did not surprise
the young law student that no one was in the
tower. He and the two policemen immediately
set about looking for clues to Irene’s whereabouts.
But it was not until Dale drew back
the wardrobe curtain and they found her yellow
dress and jacket hanging there that they became
truly alarmed. Now they knew, past any
doubt, that Irene had visited her grandmother’s
house. There had been a funeral! Even if it
had been Sarah Glenn’s, Irene might have been
with her when she died. Alone with a crazy
woman ... timid little Irene!</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a sober moment for all of them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>“That girl’s been held captive all right,” one
of the policemen said in a voice more troubled
than one would expect of an officer of the law.
“It looks as if we’ve found the evidence right
here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He stood examining the folds of her yellow
dress. It appeared to have been hanging in
the wardrobe for some time. Other clothes
were there, too, but the full skirts and puffed
sleeves were in the style of twenty years ago.
On a shelf above them were two or three queer
little hats, all decked out with feathers and
flowers. Irene would have laughed at them.
She would have tried them on and posed before
the comical mirrors. Judy wondered if she
had done that.</p>

<p class='c005'>Someone, apparently, had tried on one of the
aprons. It was a simple gingham affair such
as girls used to wear to protect dainty dresses,
and it had been thrown carelessly over a chair.
When Judy made a move to hang it up she was
warned to leave everything exactly as it was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If this turns out to be a murder case,” one
of the policemen said, “this bedroom may contain
important evidence.” He turned to Dale
who still held the rose he had found on the
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>steps. “That flower proves that the funeral
must have been held today. It’s still sweet,”
he continued, making a grimace as he sniffed it.
“We’ll get together all the facts on the case
and have the place watched. If this man, Jasper
Crosby, returns tonight there’ll be a policeman
here to nab him. A general alarm will be
dispatched to our radio cars, and we’ll find out
whose funeral it was, too, and let you know
first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, if you only would,” Judy cried gratefully.
“Perhaps you can find out from my employer.
She’s decided to take a vacation for
some unknown reason but you may be able to
locate her here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She gave them Emily Grimshaw’s home address.
Peter Dobbs, who had taken a keen interest
in the legal aspect of the case, jotted it
down, too. Much to Dale’s discomfiture, he kept
talking about Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If we find her,” he declared, “this may be
my big opportunity. She would contest the
will, of course, and I might be able to help
her then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>If</i> we find her,” Dale repeated doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>Later Peter gave Judy the address and telephone
number of the hotel where he was staying.
He would be either there or at the police
station in case she needed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I do call you,” Judy promised, with an
attempt at lightness, “you may be sure that I’m
in trouble because it’s really your place to
call me.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>ANOTHER JULIET</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>No matter what happens the trivialities of
life must go on. Food must be cooked and
eaten, no matter how dry it tastes. Work must
be done. Judy knew that and dragged her
tired body out of bed. She dressed and went
down into the kitchen where Mary made coffee
and brought out the toaster. Pauline had left
for school, she said. Would Judy mind the
toast herself?</p>

<p class='c005'>She nodded, staring at the coffeepot and
wondering if Irene would ever sit across the
breakfast table and drink coffee with her again.
She let the toast burn and threw it away. Then
she put on a second piece, watched it until it
turned golden brown and flipped it over.</p>

<p class='c005'>The doorbell rang!</p>

<p class='c005'>Always, when the doorbell rang, there came
that sudden exaltation. It might be news of
Irene! Peter might have found her! With
each new disappointment Judy’s hopes for
Irene’s safe return sank lower.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>This time it was not Peter. It was Arthur
Farringdon-Pett, the young pilot-engineer,
who owned his own airplane and had taken
Judy for a never-to-be-forgotten ride far
above the beautiful St. Lawrence River.
Judy’s brother, Horace, stood in the doorway
beside him, and both of them looked as if they
had not slept for a week. Horace’s usually
sleek hair was disordered and Arthur needed a
shave. He was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Any news of Irene?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t you bring any?” she asked. And
before they could answer she went on saying
how sure she was that they must have news
or they wouldn’t have flown all the way to
New York. She could tell they had been flying
as they were still dressed for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We were in too much of a hurry to bother
changing these togs at the hangar where I left
the plane,” Arthur explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s all right,” Judy murmured, trying
to shake off the queer feeling she had that he
was some stranger.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We do have news,” Horace told her finally,
“but, I’m sorry to say, it’s not news of Irene.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>“What is it then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“News of her mother. We thought it might
help you find her. I mean Irene. Her mother,
of course, is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew that,” Judy said. “But she has
relatives. I’m sure your news will help me.”
Taking their things, she invited the boys to sit
down and share her breakfast while they told
her. She poured out the extra coffee Mary had
made and pushed her brother into a chair.
Arthur found his own and soon all three were
seated beside the table. The boys explained
their delay.</p>

<p class='c005'>They had expected to arrive a day earlier
but when Horace and Honey called at the sanitarium
they found that Mr. Lang was gone.
Immediately, Horace telephoned Arthur who
agreed to help search for him in his plane. It
would have been easy to find him if, as they
expected, he had taken the straight road for
New York. But his crippled legs gave out and,
toward evening, they found him helpless in the
edge of a deep wood. Here, while they were
waiting for the ambulance to take him back to
the hospital, Mr. Lang told his story.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>When Tom Lang was a young man, only
eighteen or twenty, he had worked as a chauffeur
for a wealthy family in Brooklyn. The
daughter of the house gave parties, a great
many of them, and after the parties Tom would
drive the whole crowd of young people home.
He never paid much attention to them until,
one night, a new girl came to a party. She was
different from all the others. She had glamour,
radiance, all the qualities a man wants in a
girl. But the young chauffeur dared not hope
that she would have any use for him. She only
came to the one party—like a princess in her
golden dress and slippers. He took her home
and remembered the house. After that he
would drive past it, always hoping that she
would see him.</p>

<p class='c005'>And one day she did! She waved to him from
the tower window. Finally he understood,
from the motion of her hand, that she wanted
to come down—and couldn’t. The door locked
from the outside, and her tiny key was of no
use from within. Clutching it in her hand, she
leaned farther and farther out of the tower
window.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>Just like the princess in Tom’s old fairy
book. He would be the brave knight and rescue
her. There was a rope in the car. It had been
used as a towing rope but would now serve a
nobler purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'>He swung one end of it up to the tower; he
saw the slim white hand reach out and grasp
it, the lithe body throw itself over the window
sill and descend—slowly, slowly. She was almost
to the ground when the rope came loose
from where she had fastened it.</p>

<p class='c005'>She fell!</p>

<p class='c005'>Quick as a flash, Tom Lang caught her in his
strong young arms. That same day he made
her his bride. She lived just long enough to
bear him a little daughter, the image of herself.
Heartbroken, Irene’s father had never
spoken of her. But he had saved her golden
wedding dress and on Irene’s seventeenth
birthday sent it to her with a letter explaining
his gift and enclosing the key to her tower
room. His Annie had been just seventeen.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c005'>“Romantic, wasn’t it?” Arthur asked after
Horace had told the story as only a reporter
could tell it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>Judy, who had listened to it all without making
any comment, admitted that it was the most
romantic true story she had ever heard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But Mr. Lang didn’t give Irene the name
or address,” Arthur said thoughtfully. “He
only sent the key to her mother’s room because
he wanted her to have it as a remembrance.
In fact, he told so little in his letter that it
seems impossible—unthinkable—that she could
have found her grandmother——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Unless she found the same description
somewhere else,” Judy interrupted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but where?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In her grandmother’s poems. She and I
read them together.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy did not add that the manuscripts were
now missing and that she felt almost certain
that Irene had taken them to help locate her
relatives. That knowledge was confined to four
persons: Pauline, Dale Meredith, Peter and
herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fact that Irene’s grandmother wrote
poems surprised Arthur. He had heard the
popular song, <i>Golden Girl</i>, but had never connected
it with Irene, probably, because he had
never seen her in her mother’s golden dress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you say the poet’s name is Glenn?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>“It’s really Holiday,” Judy explained. “She
wrote under a nom de plume.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the boys couldn’t remember ever hearing
the name Joy Holiday. Mr. Lang had
called his wife simply Annie.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Judy had finished a complete account
of the police search through Sarah Glenn’s
house they were more puzzled than ever. But
they appeared to be simply puzzled—not
alarmed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll find out all about it,” Horace promised,
“when we find Irene.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was good to hear them saying “when.”
It gave Judy new courage. She would need
courage to get through that day. She told
them her plans. First they were to get in
touch with the police to learn what they could
of the funeral that had been held in Sarah
Glenn’s house. Judy then suggested that
Horace and Arthur call on Dale Meredith and
ask his advice while she spent a few hours in
Emily Grimshaw’s office.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be of more use there than anywhere
else,” she said. “Besides, it’s my job and I’m
being paid for it. Irene comes first, of course.
But the police are doing all they can, and if I
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>could see Emily Grimshaw and talk with her—well,
I might find out some things that even the
police don’t know. We discovered a card on the
floor when we searched the poet’s house. It
showed that my employer must have attended
the funeral.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Both boys agreed that Emily Grimshaw’s
office was the place for Judy. Knowing that
there must be stacks of papers for her to read
and correct, Judy even consented to their plan
that she go to the office at once and await news
of Irene there. They would go on to the Parkville
police station and telephone her. Peter
had gone there and they might meet him.</p>

<p class='c005'>After giving them explicit directions, Judy
walked with them as far as the subway station
at Union Square. There they separated, Judy
taking the uptown train while the boys boarded
an express for Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Horace turned to Arthur and spoke above
the roar of the train.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What puzzles me is how Irene found that
house with nothing but a few crazy verses to
go by, and I think that Judy knows if only she
would tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>“She certainly knows something more,” he
agreed, “but I’m not worrying. Judy is on
the square.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe she is,” Horace replied, “but
what about Irene?”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>TRAPPED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Just as she had expected, Judy found plenty
of work waiting for her. The clerk at the hotel
desk gave her a pile of manuscripts left by
hopeful young authors. She glanced through
these, waiting for the telephone to ring. All of
them seemed inexcusably bad. Why, she wondered,
did so many people waste their time trying
to write when they had no idea of plot
construction or character development?... Why
didn’t the telephone ring? Peter must
have had time to reach the police station.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of Emily Grimshaw’s old clients came in
and offered Judy another book manuscript.
This was better than the others. She promised
to read it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But where is Miss Grimshaw?” the author
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Away,” Judy said briefly. “She left me
in charge.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>Cautioning her to take care of the manuscript,
the caller left. Judy’s despondent mood
returned. It all seemed such a futile undertaking,
helping struggling young authors who were
trying to write about life when life itself was
so much more important—Irene’s life.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the telephone rang and Judy recognized
Arthur’s voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We just missed Peter. Did he call you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not yet,” Judy answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then he couldn’t have heard the latest
police report! The man who lets garage space
to Jasper Crosby saw him driving out of the
garage yesterday, and a girl was with him. It
might have been Irene? That was in the morning,
an hour or so after you called at the house.
We haven’t learned anything else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing about the funeral?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We haven’t learned anything else,” Arthur
repeated. “Jasper Crosby’s car is still out of
the garage but the police have the license number.
They’ll be watching for him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you think he took Irene—away?”
Judy’s voice broke. She knew what might have
happened and so did he. It was impossible to
talk.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>Dale Meredith called up a little later and
seemed very hopeful when he learned that Irene
had been seen only the day before.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s alive then!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean she <i>was</i> alive,” Judy amended
gravely. “She must have been in the tower,
and I was too frightened to do anything then.
Now it may be too late. Jasper Crosby took
her away in the car, and there was a funeral
since then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t think it was Irene’s funeral.
Honestly, I don’t. So keep on hoping and call
me as soon as anything new develops.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy promised him that she would and
turned to see the door slowly opening.</p>

<p class='c005'>There stood Jasper Crosby himself!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s Emily Grimshaw?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>It took courage of the highest order for Judy
to answer him calmly, in a businesslike voice.
But she knew that she must. He must not know
that she had ever seen or heard of Irene. She
must not reveal that she had ever been near the
house with the crumbling tower.</p>

<p class='c005'>Assuming the manner of a disinterested
clerk, she replied, “Miss Grimshaw is away.
She left me in charge. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>“Plenty,” he cried. An angry flush spread
over his face. “You can tell me for one thing
what happened to my sister’s poetry. The publishers
say that they have never seen it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy pretended surprise. She rose and stood
beside the man, her back against the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There must have been some mistake,” she
went on. “You can search Miss Grimshaw’s
desk yourself and see if the poems are there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thanks! I will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He made a dive for the desk and began turning
over papers recklessly, his hawk eyes
searching every one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy, with her back still against the door,
turned the key in the lock, slowly, cautiously, so
that he would not hear. Now she had him imprisoned
in the room. He could not escape.
But neither could she! For a moment she felt
completely at his mercy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The poems aren’t here,” he announced in a
voice that boded no good for Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Quickly, then, she planned her course of
action. She breathed a silent prayer that she
might not fail. Aloud she said, “I’ll call Emily
Grimshaw and ask her what happened to the
manuscripts.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>He muttered something about making it
snappy and Judy walked over to the telephone.
She began dialing a number. But it was not
Emily Grimshaw’s number. It was the number
Peter Dobbs had given her!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello!” his voice sounded over the wire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy glanced at Jasper Crosby who stood
near the desk. He was watching her like a cat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello! Miss Grimshaw? This is Judy.
Jasper Crosby is here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who? What?” Peter sputtered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jasper Crosby. He’s here in the office. He
wants to know what happened to the poetry.
Will you come right over?”</p>

<p class='c005'>There followed a moment of silence. Jasper’s
eyes seemed to be taking an X-ray picture of
Judy’s mind. She felt that he must know she
had not been talking to her employer. Then
Peter’s voice, lowered and tense, “You bet your
life I’ll come right over. And I’ll have the
whole police force with me. Brave little
Judy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She replaced the receiver and turned to
Jasper Crosby.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’ll be right over. Will you wait?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>“Wait nothing,” he muttered. “Why should
I wait? Say, who was that you were talking
to then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Emily Grimshaw,” Judy lied gallantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mighty queer. She’s home sick and then
you call her up and she promises to get right
up and come. Funny sickness, I call it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who said she’s sick?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, she took a fainting spell at the funeral
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whose funeral?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He detected the anxious note in her voice and
became suspicious.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody’s business whose funeral it was.
Emily Grimshaw can tell you. She was there.
I’ll be back later to see about the poetry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re not going!” Judy cried in alarm as
he turned toward the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not? There’s nothing to keep me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy’s thoughts answered him in a whirl.
“Oh, but there is, Mr. Crosby. There’s a locked
door to keep you, and if you find out that I
locked it you will know that I set a trap for
you, that I must have known about Irene’s disappearance.
You’ll be furious! You may kill
me before Peter and the police get here.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>In reality she said, “Please, Mr. Crosby.
Miss Grimshaw will be only a minute and I
would like to see this misunderstanding about
the poetry cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You would, eh? Interested, aren’t you? So
damned interested that you go prowling around
our house like a thief.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This startled Judy so much that she could
only gasp.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’d you want of my sister?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wanted to tell her about the poetry,” Judy
answered quickly. “You see, it’s—it’s lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The deuce it is! Then how’s Emily Grimshaw
going to help matters by coming over?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She may know where it is. She was, well—intoxicated
when it disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper Crosby gave a dry chuckle. “Eh!
heh! She can’t even stay sober at a funeral.
I’ll be going now. Got to see a lawyer and sue
the old lady for the loss of my sister’s manuscripts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no! Wait a minute! Miss Grimshaw
may have them. In fact, I’m almost sure she
has,” Judy cried in a panic. Anything to stall
him, keep him talking until help came.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>“Then tell her to send ’em to the publishers
and make it snappy! I’m going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy laid her hand firmly on his arm.
“You’re not going, Mr. Crosby. You’re going
to wait for Emily Grimshaw.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s giving orders around here?” he
snapped. “I tell you I’m going!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wrenching away from her, he bolted for the
door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy realized that she had held him off as
long as she could. Now if Peter would only
come—and come quickly!</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper Crosby tried the door. Then he
turned to Judy with an oath. “So that’s your
game, is it? Well, it won’t work. See? Better
give me that key right now, sister.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will not give you the key.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I’ll take it from you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can’t!” Judy cried as he lurched toward
her. “You don’t know where it is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you’ll tell me!” He grabbed her by
the shoulders and shook her until she felt dizzy
and faint. “You’ll tell me, do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will—not,” she gasped. “Let me go!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>His grip on her shoulders tightened. It hurt.
It hurt terribly and Judy wanted to cry out for
help. But if she screamed the hotel clerk would
force open the door and Jasper Crosby would
be free.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you wh-where the key is,” she managed
to say. “It’s—it’s in the small drawer of
my desk under that pile of typewriter ribbon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked at Judy shrewdly. He knew better
than that. Judy was not used to deceiving
people and her timidity betrayed her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You lie!” he shouted. “That key’s on you
and I know it. But I don’t need a key. I’ll
break down the door!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And rouse the whole hotel?” Judy asked
quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>His hands clutched her throat now. “Then
give me the key!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She could feel it, the cold little key that she
had thrust down her neck. It felt colder still
when her breath was short. She tried to
scream but found she could make no sound. It
was then that she thought of his hands on Irene.
His relentless hands....</p>

    <div>TO THE RESCUE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“This way, officer. Here’s the suite. Judy!”
Peter Dobbs shouted.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the policemen rattled the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s locked,” he announced, “and nobody
answers. Give me your night stick, partner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The sound of splintering wood announced
that the door was open. The center panel, with
Emily Grimshaw’s unique knocker, fell to the
floor and revealed the face of Jasper Crosby,
white as a ghost. Judy lay limp at his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s choked her!” Peter said between set
teeth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before Jasper had time to turn his head he
had him by the collar. One of the policemen
clapped handcuffs over his wrists. The other
two jerked him to a corner while Peter lifted
Judy gently in his arms and placed her on the
sofa.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brave little girl,” he whispered and kissed
her closed eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>She opened them, hardly believing that this
was the same boy who had shared so many adventures
with her. She had imagined Arthur
kissing her—sometime when they grew older—but
not Peter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m always needing someone to rescue me,”
she said, trying to laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And doesn’t it make any difference who it
is?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, a little,” she returned lightly. “I
called you, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He studied her face, looking sorry about
something, and after a few minutes he rose and
said gruffly, “Come, we must hear what Jasper
Crosby has to say for himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She followed him to the corner where the
prisoner sat sullenly on a chair. At first he
would say nothing, but later when Judy questioned
him about the funeral his attitude
changed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s no secret about that,” he declared.
“My sister is the one who died. I’ll give you
the names of the doctor and undertaker to
verify what I say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then the funeral was Sarah Glenn’s?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper nodded.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>“But what became of Irene? We know she
went to your sister’s house and we know she
never returned. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper Crosby grinned. “I’ll tell you if
you’re so anxious to know. I thought she was
a mite young to be traveling about New York.
Yes, Miss, a mite young and irresponsible. So
I sent her back to her father. Even paid her
train fare and saw her off. Pretty decent of
me, don’t you think, seeing she’s a perfect
stranger?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When did this happen?” Judy demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper Crosby let his eyes rove thoughtfully
about the room before he answered. He seemed
content that the girl, not the policemen, was
questioning him. As Judy’s questions were
pertinent they, too, seemed content.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sent Irene to her father some time ago,”
he said finally.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were seen with her yesterday morning,”
said Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, yes. Yesterday morning. That was it.
I sent her home yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your two stories don’t jibe,” one of the
policemen snapped.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>“Yesterday morning is some time ago to
me,” Jasper Crosby replied suavely. “Much
has happened since then. There has been a
funeral,” he chuckled, “quite a funeral, too.
Miss Grimshaw had a gay time of it all right,
all right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did Irene attend the funeral?” Judy asked,
ignoring his last statement.</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked surprised. “Oh, no indeed. She
did not attend.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were pretty careful to keep her out of
sight, weren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She was with my sister constantly,” he replied.
“She had no desire to leave the house
as long as my sister needed her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy turned to Peter. “It doesn’t sound true,
does it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the blackest lie I ever heard,” he declared
vehemently. “He can’t tell us that Irene
stayed with a crazy woman of her own free will
and made no attempt to get in touch with her
friends. There’s been crooked work somewhere.
If he sent Irene home, where is she
now?” Peter questioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps she’s visiting someone else,” Judy
suggested hopefully.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>Peter shook his head. “I don’t believe it.
In any case she would have been in touch
with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The policemen agreed that Jasper’s story
was not a very convincing one. Dale Meredith
came in while they were still questioning him.
Horace and Arthur were with him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll get something out of this bird,” Horace
declared. “Officer, have I your permission to
question him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fire away,” the policeman replied, “and
more power to you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horace turned to Jasper with flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did Irene say the day she came, and
if, as you say, she is not your niece how did she
happen to enter your sister’s house?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper shrugged his shoulders and made a
gesture indicating wheels going around.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They cast spells, you know. Crazy people
do. My sister’s eyes took possession of Irene.
Hypnotized her completely. I never saw two
people so attached to each other. Crazy as
loons, both of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene Lang’s mind was perfectly sound,”
Horace denied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you my sister hypnotized her,” Jasper
maintained.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>As Judy listened to the explanation that her
brother drew from Jasper Crosby, she found
herself almost believing it. Sarah Glenn’s reaction
to Irene’s sudden appearance had been
similar to Emily Grimshaw’s, only more pronounced.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper had been the one to open the door.
Irene had inquired for her grandmother, but
before he could speak the poet herself had
rushed forward, almost smothering Irene in a
tearful embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Joy! My Joy! I <i>knew</i> you would come
back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she had turned to Jasper with accusing
eyes. “I told you the child wasn’t dead.
Angels don’t die. My darling! Darling!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Irene had submitted to her embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>No amount of reasoning could dissuade the
old lady from her queer conviction. She had
seen her daughter’s dead body, Jasper declared,
but in spite of that she claimed this living
girl as hers. Irene had answered to the
name of Joy, pretended to remember touching
little things out of the past, even fondled old
playthings to please the poet. Like Golden Girl
in the song she, too, had been a princess enthroned
in her circular tower. There she had
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>stayed. Jasper brought food, clothing, all the
little things that a girl might need. He even
moved a bed into the tower room so that she
could sleep there. He called her Joy, too, to
please his sister and pretended to think that
she was the dead Joy Holiday returned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the last few nights,” he continued his
narrative, “she caused some trouble. My sister
died, very peacefully, with Irene at her bedside.
But after that the girl refused to go to her
room. She had an obsession that the tower
wasn’t safe and refused to sleep there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, is it safe?” Peter charged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s been propped up ever since my sister
tried to kill herself and set fire to the house.
Sure, it’s safe!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As long as the props hold.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jasper Crosby gave a dry chuckle with no
mirth in it. There was something maniacal
about it—something that frightened Judy. She
spoke to Peter in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s trying to prove that Irene is insane
just as he tried to prove, years ago, that her
mother was dead. This time we won’t let him
get away with it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>“You bet we won’t!” Peter, Arthur and Dale
joined in agreement.</p>

<p class='c005'>The policemen promised to make a check-up
of train passengers to determine if any part of
Jasper Crosby’s story might be true.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s a mighty slippery prisoner,” one of
them said. “If he hadn’t assaulted the girl
there I doubt if we would be able to bring
charges against him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I’m glad he did it,” Judy said unexpectedly.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c004' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap24' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>PREMONITION</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Judy had a threefold reason for being glad.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had accomplished Jasper Crosby’s arrest,
and except for a few bruises had suffered
no ill effects from his frenzied choking.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of doubts and suspicions as to the
veracity of the prisoner’s story, part of it must
be true. Judy even dared hope that they were
near the end of their search for Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also she was glad that Peter Dobbs had
wanted to kiss her. It would be a new confidence
to tell Irene when she came home.</p>

<p class='c005'>All of them were saying “when” now—Arthur
and Horace were busy mapping out
plans for the day. They telephoned back to
Farringdon to find out if anyone had seen Irene.
The telephone calls were expensive and brought
nothing but disappointment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even Pauline Faulkner seemed impressed
when she heard of the terrifying things that
had happened.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>“And here I was in school, not helping at all,
but today,” she declared, “I’ll make up for it.
There isn’t any more school until graduation
and I’m free to help you. Emily Grimshaw’s
work has waited so long that there must be a
deluge of unread manuscripts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It has waited so long that it can easily wait
a little longer,” Judy said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But isn’t it important?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not as important as finding Irene.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know, but haven’t you done everything
you can do? The boys can keep in touch with
the police while I stay here and help you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It really was best that way. And how kind of
Pauline to offer to help! Dale suggested that
she and Judy both go home and rest as soon as
the work was done. But, unfortunately, it was
Mary’s day off.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll bring in the dinner,” Horace promised.
“Any of you fellows know how to
cook?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter Dobbs volunteered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And just to make things even,” Arthur put
in, “I’ll pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy laughed and felt better. She tackled the
work with some of her old enthusiasm and succeeded
in interesting Pauline in an unread
manuscript.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>After about an hour the telephone rang. It
was Dale.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sorry,” he said, “but it’s beginning to look
as if Jasper Crosby made up his story. No
tickets to Farringdon have been purchased for
a month.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you at the police station?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and they’ve made a thorough check-up.
The only answer is that Jasper Crosby lied.
And he probably lied about Irene, too. I’d like
to wring his neck!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So would I. But that’s probably better left
to the state. I only hope they make a good job
of it. If they can prove that he lied it will make
some difference in their treatment of him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Undoubtedly it did make a difference as a
detective called back later, and Judy found herself
telling him even more than she had told
Lieutenant Collins. The one thing she omitted
was the fact that she believed Irene had stolen
her grandmother’s poetry. It was Jasper
Crosby she was trying to have convicted, not
Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>The case was being expertly handled. The
knowledge that Jasper Crosby was in jail,
charged with assaulting Judy and kidnaping
Irene, was some satisfaction. They would keep
him right there, too, until Irene’s whereabouts
were known.</p>

<p class='c005'>The day dragged on. Emily Grimshaw’s
work seemed to take longer now that Judy had
lost heart again. It was good to have Pauline
there helping. She read. She typed and when
everything else was done she asked Judy if
she might see her carbon copies of Sarah
Glenn’s poetry. “I wanted to read them myself,”
she said in explanation. “It’s a slim
chance, I know, but it might help us in our
search.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve studied and studied this one myself,”
Judy said as she handed her a copy of that first
poem Emily Grimshaw had given her as a test.
No wonder she had said there was too much
truth in it! The tower of flame, the ghosts—all,
all of it might be true. Even the “human
tomcat” that the poet had mentioned they believed
to mean Irene’s father, Tom Lang.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, through these very poems, Irene had
found her mother’s people. It would be such
a thrilling, romantic thing to happen if only
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>they could talk it over with her. If only they
knew where she was. If only she hadn’t taken
the manuscripts....</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy showed Pauline the poem that Jasper
Crosby had brought in after Irene’s disappearance.
Now that they knew where Irene must
have been, they both saw new significance in
the lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Death cannot touch the halo of your hair.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though, like a ghost, you disappear at will.</div>
      <div class='line'>I knew you’d come in answer to my prayer ...</div>
      <div class='line'>You, gentle sprite, whom love alone can kill ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Jasper Crosby never killed her with love,”
Pauline said bitterly. “I only hope——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t say it, Pauline!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked sorry. “I won’t say anything
more. We’ll just keep on hoping.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Five o’clock came and Judy closed her desk
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve worked hard,” she said to Pauline,
“but I just feel as if another day has been
wasted. While we sit here who knows what
may be happening to Irene?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>“At least we know that beastly uncle of hers
can’t be hurting her any more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy thought of Pauline’s statement in connection
with death—not to be hurt any more.
Old people wanted that kind of peace, that
freedom from pain and fear. Death could be
kind to old people who were through with romance
and adventure. But Irene had so much
to live for.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The boys must be there ahead of us,” Judy
remarked as she and Pauline came in sight of
the house. “See, someone has raised the
window.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They probably burnt something,” Pauline
said shortly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Apparently she had misgivings concerning
Peter’s ability as a cook. It was early for them
to be home. Why, it couldn’t have been an hour
since they left the police station in Parkville
and there would be shopping for them to do besides.</p>

<p class='c005'>As they turned down the corridor that led to
Pauline’s room Judy heard a familiar yowl.
Could it be Blackberry asking to be let out?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>“But he wasn’t in,” Pauline said. “Don’t
you remember? We left him on the roof
garden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe the boys let him in. But it’s queer
they’re not making any noise. You open the
door, Pauline,” Judy whispered. “I have the
strangest feeling that something is about to
happen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pauline hesitated, glanced at Judy and caught
her hand as the door swung open. Neither of
the girls had touched it!</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

  <h2 id='chap25' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>THE HAPPY ENDING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pauline stood transfixed while Judy gathered
Irene in her arms. If people fainted for joy
she would have done it then. At first there
were no explanations. Neither Judy nor Pauline
expected any. The supreme realization
that Irene was there—alive, safe—sufficed.
Kisses were mingled with tears as Pauline,
too, pressed closer to the golden-haired girl.
If they had ever doubted Irene’s sincerity, suspected
her of anything, it was all forgotten
at the moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s so good to see you again,” Irene said
at last. “There was nobody but Blackberry
here to welcome me when I came in. It was
almost as quiet as the house in Parkville after
my grandmother died.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor you!” Judy cried. “We found out
all about that wicked uncle of yours and he’s in
jail now. Believe me, Irene, he wanted to get
your grandmother’s property and would have
done anything to be rid of you. Oh, I’m so—glad—you’re
safe——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>But Judy was sobbing again, clinging to
Irene as if she might vanish if she released her
hand. Together she and Pauline led her to the
sofa where each of them found a seat close beside
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was growing dark and Judy lit the bridge
lamp. It shone down on Irene’s hair. Something
brighter than lamplight glowed, suddenly,
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s Dale?” she asked. “Has he
missed me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He thinks of nothing but you,” Judy answered.
“Horace and Peter and Arthur are
here, too. All of them were hunting for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How thrilling! Did they like Dale, too?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Everybody likes him,” Pauline put in.
“Lucky girl! They say absence makes the
heart grow fonder, and I shouldn’t wonder if
he fell in love with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m almost sure of it,” Pauline replied.
She spoke softly and only Irene heard her.
Judy ran to the window.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>“They’re coming! I heard their voices.
Dale!” she called down to the street. “Arthur!
Peter! Dale! Hurry!”</p>

<p class='c005'>That was all she said. That was all she
needed to say. The trembling joy in her voice
told them the rest. In less time than seemed
possible Dale burst through the half-open door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene!” he cried. “Am I dreaming or is
this my lost princess, my Golden Girl?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s he talking about?” Horace said
gruffly to Judy. “Are they engaged?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy smiled, watching their embrace. “Not
yet, but we can guess they will be before long.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale and Irene faced the others. Radiance
was in their faces.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s been quite a detective story,” Dale
said, “and this is the happy ending. Now,
Irene, dear, suppose we go out on the roof garden—all
of us—and you explain everything.
I’m perfectly sure you can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The others followed, eager to hear the story
they had nearly given up hope of hearing from
Irene’s own lips. It proved to be almost identical
with Jasper Crosby’s story. Irene had
not been forced to stay in her grandmother’s
house. She had stayed of her own free will because
the old lady was sick and needed her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>“At first it was fun, almost like playing princess,”
Irene said. “I let her call me Joy and
I called her Mother. I pretended to remember
things my own mother must have done. I
read aloud from her books and wore her
dresses. This is one.” She touched the simple
white silk dress she was wearing and explained
that she had intended to wear it to her grandmother’s
funeral. “But then Uncle Jasper
decided that I must not go. He said that being
with her when she died had affected my mind. I
believed him then but now that I’m home again
I feel sure that it wasn’t true. Still, there’s
something like a magnet that just draws me
back to that dear old house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your grandmother’s house?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My house now, isn’t it, Peter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young law student looked up with a
start. He had forgotten all about the will in
the excitement of having Irene safe again. But
she had changed so! He couldn’t quite understand
this new, beautiful Irene—this Irene who
was an heiress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, er—yes,” he said. “I believe everything
is legally yours, even the royalties from
that new book Emily Grimshaw is publishing.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>Dale and Judy looked first at each other and
then at Irene. Both of them were wondering
the same thing. How could Emily Grimshaw
have the book published if the manuscripts
were missing? Dale was the first to put the
thought into words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They aren’t missing any more,” Irene replied
and darted back inside the door. When
the others had joined her in Pauline’s sitting
room she opened a small suitcase that stood on
the floor and gave the papers a toss onto the
table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There they are—every blessed one of them.
I packed them with my things so Uncle Jasper
wouldn’t see me take them. Why don’t you
give them all back to Emily Grimshaw in the
morning?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what will I tell her?” gasped Judy. “I
can’t tell her you stole them. What will I say?
Oh, why did you do it? Can’t you see all the
trouble it has caused? Really, Irene, you’re
dreadfully hard-hearted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I?” The golden-haired girl smiled
wanly. “And all the time I thought you were,
not to come and see me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How could we have come?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>“I told you in my letter. It explained everything
but now, oh, now it’s going to be harder
to explain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What letter? Did you get a letter?” Dale
turned and demanded of Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then how did you find out where I was?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter explained this question to Irene. He
told her about the radio broadcast, the police
activities and how earnestly all of them had
searched. It seemed that the tables had turned
and they, not Irene, were doing the explaining.
But what could have happened to Irene’s letter?
She said she had written three.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I gave them to Uncle Jasper to mail——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy interrupted with a little cry. “There’s
your explanation. He must have destroyed
them. The miserable old cheat! Was he mean
to you, Irene?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She sighed. “This is the part I hardly dare
tell. He made me think it was an—an hallucination.
You know, like crazy people get. But
I was in the tower lying on my bed. I’d been
up all night and he told me to rest. It was
right after Grandma died. Well, he moved
the bed across the room—way across and I
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>felt a little queer as if it weren’t quite safe. I
knew the tower was only propped up. Then he
got ugly. He told me I was going insane. He
said if I didn’t lie in the bed he’d tie me there.
So I lay down. In a little while I heard some
one rapping on the door and I ran to the window.
I saw you, Judy, but you didn’t hear me
call. You were almost out of sight. Then I
looked down, and, as sure as I’m alive, there
was Uncle Jasper taking the props out from
under the tower. One of them fell and struck
him across the chest. I think,” she added,
turning to Peter, “that there must be marks on
his chest to prove that what I say is true.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a serious charge, Irene. He could do
twenty years for that. But he deserves it if
what you say is true.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s true. And, oh, I was so frightened. I
ran downstairs and I guess I was screaming—or
crying—or both. Anyway, he quit hammering
at the props. He had a sledge hammer and
a long beam to work with. That was so the
tower wouldn’t fall on him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You remember that long beam we used to
break down the door?” Dale interrupted her
to ask.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Both Judy and Peter nodded. Their faces
were grave. Blackberry, who possessed a cat’s
inborn capacity for sympathy, came forth from
his corner and looked up at Irene. She patted
him as she went on talking.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle Jasper got scared then. He said he’d
have to get me back to my father in a hurry.
He explained how he was really putting more
props under the tower and said it was because
my mind wasn’t right that I had been afraid he
would kill me. He told me that if I didn’t want
to go to the insane asylum I’d keep still about
the whole thing. I said I would but it wasn’t
true and I’m sure he didn’t believe me. Then
he took me riding in the car but he didn’t take
the road for Farringdon. I don’t know where
he intended to take me but wherever it was, I
didn’t want to go. So, when he had to slow
down for a railroad crossing, I jumped out of
the car. He was busy driving and didn’t miss
me until afterwards. By that time I had started
hiking. So here I am and I guess that explains
everything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene sank back in her chair and looked, suddenly,
tired. Judy realized that she must be
hungry too. She remembered the packages that
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>the boys had brought in, and all of them set
about preparing food and something for Irene
to drink. She wanted coffee with plenty of
cream. The same Irene, dear child! Judy
didn’t care if she never explained about the
poetry.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>HER MAJESTY ARRIVES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The meal that Peter Dobbs cooked and served
was a merry one. Truly, it was an occasion for
rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A party after all,” Dale said. He told
Irene about the other party and how they
waited and waited.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy sat between Arthur and Peter dividing
her attention between them. She rose, lifted
her glass of water and gave a toast:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Happiness for all of us! Here’s how!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her gayety was contagious. Everybody was
laughing now. It was good to be able to laugh
with Irene again. She was just meant to be
spoiled and laughed with Dale declared.</p>

<p class='c005'>Horace brought in dessert. Like children at
a birthday party everybody screamed, “Ice
cream! Hurray for ice cream!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And cake,” he added. “It’s a little late,
Irene, but we might call this your birthday
cake.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>He placed a foamy creation of walnuts and
chocolate at her place. She cut the first slice
for Dale and the second slice for Horace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now you, Judy,” she went on, flourishing
the knife, “and a little crumb for Blackberry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The cat caught it in his paws and played with
it, like a mouse, before he ate it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To think that I used to dislike him,” Dale
said apologetically.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everyone was served now. Judy remembered
the two extra candles left over from the party
that hadn’t been a party. She brought them
out and Irene lit them. How golden everything
looked in their light! Irene’s eyes shone.
Her hair was a halo around her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re beautiful,” Dale said softly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy heard him and smiled, sharing their
happiness. She turned to the others. “It’s
worth waiting for—this kind of a party, isn’t
it, people?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll dance afterwards,” Pauline suggested.
She excused herself to turn on the
radio, hoping to tune in on Irene’s song. But
before she found anything worth while the
doorbell rang.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>“I’ll answer it,” Irene cried. “I feel like
surprising somebody and I’m sure, whoever it
is, they’ll be terribly surprised.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They were all watching Irene as she danced
toward the door, quite unprepared for the kind
of surprise that awaited her on the other side.</p>

<p class='c005'>She swung it open. There, framed in the
doorway, stood Her Majesty, Emily Grimshaw.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve come to settle with you, Joy Holiday,”
she shouted and raised a threatening finger at
Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three boys stared in blank bewilderment.
They had never seen this strange old lady and
imagined that she must be an escaped inmate
from some near-by asylum—except that she had
used the now familiar name, Joy Holiday.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chairs were pushed back from the table.
Dale Meredith rose and strode over to the door,
followed by Judy and Peter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s this?” the indignant young author
demanded. “Miss Grimshaw, what’s the big
idea of storming in here and frightening
Irene?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who has a better right?” she retorted belligerently.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>Taking her gently by the shoulders, Peter
pushed her into a chair. “Sit down quietly now
while we finish dinner. No need to raise a row
about it. I’m sure Irene will be glad to listen
to what you have to say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Irene, nothing!” she fumed. “That girl’s
Johanna Holiday, the wench who made away
with her mother’s poetry. I know you!” She
pointed a shaking finger at the trembling Irene.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy, standing near the old lady, caught a
whiff of her breath and guessed that she had
taken an overdose from the bottle that she
called her tonic. She had noticed how frequently
her employer resorted to the stimulant.
After a few drinks she always talked freely of
spirits. But Judy was in no mood for listening
to ghost stories now.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know you!” the indomitable old lady repeated.
“I saw you, Joy Holiday, just before
your mother’s funeral. Break her heart while
she lived and then come back to gloat over her
when she’s dead. You’re a devil, you are. Only
devils are immune to death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale moved closer to Irene as if to ward off
the blows that must come to her senses with
the old lady’s words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve got to get her out of here,” Peter
whispered hoarsely to Dale.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>“No! No!” Judy protested. “We must be
civil to her. There’s some black coffee on the
stove. That may sober her up a bit, and after
all we did want to see her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then let’s get Irene out of the room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You take her out on the roof garden, Dale,”
Judy begged. “I’m used to being alone with
Miss Grimshaw.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He protested at first but when he saw that
the black coffee was doing its work he finally
slipped quietly out of the door, an arm about
Irene’s waist.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the trouble?” Horace whispered.
He and Arthur couldn’t understand Emily
Grimshaw’s grievance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Too much excitement,” Judy stated briefly.
“She was at the poet’s funeral and thinks Irene
is her mother’s ghost. We’ll be able to reason
with her after a bit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what does she mean about the poetry?”
Horace insisted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy, however, would say nothing more. She
turned her attention to the old lady now, endeavoring
to engage her in a sensible conversation.
“So you were at the funeral, Miss
Grimshaw. I wondered why you hadn’t come
in to the office. When did Sarah Glenn die?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>“Lord knows!” Emily Grimshaw answered.
“But I went out there to pay my respects to the
dead. Heard about it through friends. And
there was that—that—that——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her voice trailed off in a groan. She was
pointing again but this time not at Irene but at
the vacant spot where the girl had stood.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good Lord! She’s gone again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She went out quietly,” Judy explained.
“Dale Meredith was with her. They’ll be
back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’d better be,” the irate woman answered.
“Those poems had better be back too
or I’ll know the reason why. Ghost or no ghost,
that girl can’t get away with stealing——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your poems are here,” Judy interrupted,
her voice quiet but firm. She lifted the stack
of papers from the desk, and before Emily
Grimshaw could get her breath, she had deposited
them in the startled old lady’s lap.
“Now,” she continued, “after you finish another
cup of this nice strong coffee, I’ll call
Dale and the girl back into the room and all of
us can hear her story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean Joy Holiday?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>“I mean the girl you call Joy Holiday. The
real Joy Holiday is dead. You see, she didn’t
vanish as you thought she did. She climbed
down from the tower window and eloped with
her lover. This girl is her daughter and she
was wearing her mother’s yellow dress the day
you saw her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Emily Grimshaw sat forward in her chair
and passed her hand across her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say that again. It didn’t—register.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy laughed. She could see that her employer
was coming back to her senses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You tell her, Horace.” She motioned to
her brother who had been sitting beside the
table with Pauline and Arthur, listening.</p>

<p class='c005'>Joy Holiday’s story was a real romance,
however badly told. But Horace Bolton, the
reporter, made the tale so vivid that the five
who heard it lived the adventure all over again.
Whatever else it did, it cleared Emily Grimshaw’s
clouded brain and brought the old, practical
look back into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arthur wound up by telling of his search by
air for Irene’s distracted father. Now, if only
Irene could explain about the poetry, they had
nothing to fear.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>Opening the door quietly, Judy beckoned to
the two figures who sat in the hammock. As
Dale stood up, outlined against the sky, it reminded
her of that first night that she and
Pauline had found them there and they had
been invited to that never-to-be-forgotten dance
on the hotel roof garden. She caught Irene’s
hand as she entered the door. Impulsively she
kissed her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell us about it now, dear,” she murmured.
“The boys and I will understand and I’m sure
Pauline will too. And if Emily Grimshaw gets
another queer spell we’ll send her packing with
her precious poetry. We have what we want—you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The agent looked up as Irene entered the
room. She stared for a moment as if the girl’s
golden beauty fascinated her. Then she passed
one hand across her forehead, smoothing out
the furrows that twenty years had left there.
The light of understanding came into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are ... you are the image of your
mother,” she said at last. “While you live
Joy Holiday will never be dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>“‘Death cannot touch the halo of your
hair,’” Judy quoted dreamily. “After all, it
is a beautiful thought, Irene. There’s nothing
uncanny about that kind of a spirit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t talk spirits to her,” the agent
snapped.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her seriousness brought to Judy’s mind the
phantom shape she had seen in the tower window.
Disregarding her, she asked Irene to tell
her about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The girl laughed, that familiar silvery laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It frightened me too,” she admitted, “until
Uncle Jasper told me it was only a reflection.
Then it seemed stupid of me not to have
guessed it. He said any sane person would
have. But you’re sane, Judy, and you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That proves there’s no truth in what he
said,” Horace assured her.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a great satisfaction to Irene, knowing
that. She sighed and went on explaining about
the ghost in the tower.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know, the room is round and there are
windows on all sides. Between the windows are
mirrors that make the oddest reflections. I
must have been standing in the room so that
you could see the mirror but not me. I should
think you would have been scared to death.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>“And then you pulled the shades?” Judy anticipated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I didn’t. Uncle Jasper did, just before
he went down and started taking the props out
from under the tower. That must have been
after you left.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We saw the mirrors afterwards, too—and
your yellow dress. But that was when we
searched the house. You were gone by then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and Grandma was gone, too. Poor
soul! It really made me happy to think she
could die in peace, believing that her golden
girl still lived. That poem you just quoted,
Judy, was written to me. She thought I was
immune to death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, people never do die if you look at it
that way,” Judy said thoughtfully. “Your
mother’s beauty was reborn in you, and you
may pass it on to your children and their children——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about your children?” Arthur asked,
smiling quizzically at Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>“Oh, me? I’m too young to be thinking about
them. My career comes first. Now I’m sure
Chief Kelly will listen to me when I tell him I
want to be a detective.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They all agreed. No one could doubt that
solving mysteries was Judy’s one great talent.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet—the missing poetry was still unexplained.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>WHO TOOK THE MANUSCRIPT?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>All this time Emily Grimshaw had not taken
her eyes away from Irene. Now she turned to
the others, contrition written in every line of
her face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see it all now,” she murmured. “And
I’ve been as big a fool as Sarah Glenn for all
she was supposed to be crazy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps it was the fault of that tonic you’ve
been taking,” Peter suggested, his eyes twinkling
wickedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Piffle!” the old lady snorted. “That’s good
stuff, bottled in bond. A wee bit strong,
though,” she added, shaking her head, “a wee—bit—strong.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Emily Grimshaw had her poetry and rose, a
little unsteadily, preparing to leave. It was
then that she thought of the purpose of her
visit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>“Young woman,” she demanded of Irene, “if
you’re not Joy Holiday, why did you take those
manuscripts?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t take them,” the accused girl answered,
regarding her steadily with those
starry eyes that had inspired the loveliest line
of <i>Golden Girl</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy made an almost inaudible sound of protest.
Irene couldn’t keep on denying it. No
one would believe her now. She touched her
arm and whispered, “Tell her, dear. It’s no
good pretending. The rest of us have forgiven
you and I’m sure she will too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene’s eyes widened. “Forgiven me? For
what, may I ask? Why, I didn’t see that poetry
from the moment it was taken until I found
it lying on my grandmother’s table.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You expect us to believe that, Irene?” This
was Peter’s voice, the voice he would some day
use in the court room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dale turned on him. “Of course she does.
And I do believe it. Sarah Glenn may have
taken her own poetry——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When she was too sick to move out of her
house?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>“Or Jasper Crosby may have sneaked into
the office,” Dale went on, disregarding his question.
“Irene says she didn’t take the poems
and that ends the matter once and forever. If
the rest of you want to go on distrusting her
it’s none of my affair but I knew all along that
Irene was too fine, too wonderful——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene herself stopped him. Her voice was
almost a command. “Leave them alone, Dale.
Why shouldn’t they suspect me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because you didn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene was silent. She couldn’t say any more
because the last she knew of the poems they
were in Judy’s hands. It was after all lights
were out and they were in bed that she told her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You said never to mind the work; you’d
straighten things. And then some one took
the poetry out of my hands. Wasn’t it you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It certainly wasn’t,” Judy declared. “I
had just opened the door for Dale Meredith but
he wasn’t there yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you turn your back? Could anyone
else have come in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why,” Judy exclaimed, “I believe they
could have—if they had been very quick.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle Jasper is quick. But why would he
take the poetry?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>Now Judy knew! It was like a heavy load
falling from her shoulders. She remembered
what Emily Grimshaw had said about his suing
her. He had schemed to do it and stolen the
poetry himself. Besides, he may have suspected
Irene’s identity and been afraid she would find
out too much.</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene’s eyes sought Judy’s and found in them
understanding and sympathy. She had told the
truth, and, with Judy to explain, everyone
would believe her. But she couldn’t forget that
it was Dale Meredith who had believed her
without an explanation.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>DALE’S HEROINE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Two weeks later Dale Meredith came into
Emily Grimshaw’s office and under his arm he
carried a new book manuscript. It was the day
that Pauline took over Judy’s position—with
her father’s consent. Dr. Faulkner was home
now, as busy and professional as ever. But he
had not been too busy to listen to the smallest
detail of Irene’s remarkable story. She wanted
his advice as a brain specialist. Was it fair
with insanity in the family——</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Faulkner had not let her finish the sentence.
Of course it was fair. Sarah Glenn had
once been a patient of his and he declared that
she was only slightly eccentric—not insane until
her brother had driven her to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And don’t you know that this type of insanity
cannot be inherited?” he had asked
Irene. “There’s no need to worry your pretty
head about that. Under the same conditions,
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>perhaps. But those conditions cannot exist
with Jasper Crosby in prison. And do quit
calling him Uncle Jasper. He’s no blood relation,
only a stepbrother, and Glenn was really
your grandmother’s maiden name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Father, if you had only been home before!”
Pauline had exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The doctor had smiled that rare smile of his.
“Dr. Bolton’s daughter did wonders without
me,” he had said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Pauline knew that her father would not
object to Judy’s plans for her. He hadn’t
wanted her to work before. Now it pleased
him to know she was filling Judy’s position.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c005'>“You’ve been working hard, Dale,” Pauline
said, glancing up from the manuscript he had
just given her. She was seated at her new
desk, looking very professional.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy stood beside the table straightening out
a few of her things as she wanted to leave the
office in perfect order.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Dale Meredith expected these girls to
show more than a professional interest in his
story. He had put his heart into it—and his
experience.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>Judy smiled. “Is it another detective
story?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the greatest detective story you’ll ever
read. The detective is a sixteen-year-old girl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sounds interesting. What does she look
like?”</p>

<p class='c005'>For answer Dale walked over to the little
mirror where Judy usually stood to arrange
her hat. He took it down from the wall and
held it so that Judy’s bright hair and clear
gray eyes were reflected in its surface.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There! That’s my detective. Irene is the
heroine. She has the original manuscript reading
it now. Our whole future depends on what
she thinks of the ending.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Really, Dale? Is it as serious as that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was serious enough for me to invest in
this. Do you think she’ll like it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He took from his pocket a tiny square box.
Opening it, he displayed a ring that would, had
Judy known it, play an important part in another
mystery that she was to solve. It was a
beautiful thing. Beautiful chiefly because it
was so simple, just a solitaire set in a gold band
and decorated with almost invisible orange
blossoms.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>“I even had it engraved,” he said and then
blushed, a thing Judy had never known Dale
Meredith to do before.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know why I’m showing it to you
girls,” he said. “Perhaps I shouldn’t. She
might rather show it herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Snapping shut the lid, he put it hastily back
in his pocket. He stood as if waiting for something.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be almost afraid to read your story if
it’s all true, Dale,” Judy said. “It will be so
much like—like—” She floundered for a word.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like spying on me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Something like that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, it isn’t all true—only the important
part. You’ll both read it, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course we’ll read it. That’s what we’re
being paid for, isn’t it, Pauline?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The book was a revelation. Dale had made
a murder mystery out of the very thing that
had happened to Irene. Jasper Crosby’s
scheme to wreck the tower had worked in the
story, killing the grandmother instead of Irene.
The names were different. But for that Judy
saw herself moving through the pages of his
story, playing the part of the clever girl detective.
She saw Pauline’s faults depicted. All
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>the petty jealousies she had felt were revealed,
used to cast suspicion upon her and then excused,
baring the real girl underneath. The
Golden Girl of Dale’s story was Irene in her
mother’s dress. Dale, himself, was the narrator
and the suspense, the worry and, finally,
the romance of the story were things he had
felt and written with feeling. Judy found a
new and lovelier Irene in Dale’s description of
her. She marveled that he understood every
one of them so well. The boys came, appropriately,
at the end and, through it all, the
spark of humor was the literary agent.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Emily Grimshaw came in neither Judy
nor Pauline looked up. They did not hear her
enter the room. Finally she stood over them
and spoke in a sharp tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s this you’re reading? Didn’t I tell
you to get done with your typewriting first?
Letters are important but manuscripts can always
wait to be read.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This one can’t,” Judy replied, smiling up
at her employer. “This is Dale Meredith’s new
detective story. Irene is the heroine, Pauline
one of the suspects and I am the detective.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>“So! And I suppose I am the criminal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Judy startled the old lady by kissing her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are your own sweet self, Miss Grimshaw.
It will surprise you what a lovable person
you are. Why don’t you read the book and
get acquainted?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Turning pages broke the silence in the office
all that day. Clients that came in were hastily
dismissed. Other work waited. Dale Meredith
had written life itself in the pages of a
book that would make him famous.</p>

<p class='c005'>He called for the girls at five o’clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did you think of it?” He asked when
they failed to mention his work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wonderful!” Pauline breathed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you, Judy?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m still filled with it,” she replied, “too
much to talk. Anyway, I’m going home and
there won’t be time to talk. Irene is going
also.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why on earth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because Peter has promised to take her in
his car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s been taking her out a good deal
lately,” Dale said, his brow darkening.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>“Why shouldn’t he?” Pauline asked. “Peter
is a nice boy and Irene needs somebody to help
her plan things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She knows I’d be glad to help her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sure she does. But she needs Peter’s
legal advice,” Judy explained. “He says the
chief thing they talk about is what to do with
Sarah Glenn’s house. Irene says she wants to
live in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alone?” Pauline asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, with her father. He’s still depending
on her and she is so glad to be able to take care
of him the way she’s always wanted to. His
room is to be that big sunny one in the front
of the house. There’s room for Irene’s piano
in it and he loves to hear her play. But the
tower room she wants kept just the way her
mother had it. Oh, she’s talked of it so much—even
to selecting the kind of flowers she wants
in the garden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She told me,” Dale said, but his simple remark
set Judy wondering how much they had
told each other. It seemed strange for little
Irene to be having a real romance. She was so
young! Too young, Judy would have thought
if she had not realized how much Irene needed
the love and sense of security that a man like
Dale Meredith could give her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>Bright-eyed and smiling, Irene looked the
part of a heroine when she met them at the
door. Dale promptly took possession of her
and, for an hour, nothing more was heard from
either of them except a low murmur of voices
on the roof garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the meantime Arthur had arrived dressed
in his flying gear and ready to take Judy home.
She and her cat were both to fly with him in
his open plane.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was decided that Irene would ride with
Horace in Peter’s car and stay with the Dobbs
family while she was in Farringdon. That
short stay was to be more eventful than she
knew, for her fortune was to be told in “The
Mystic Ball.” But now she was content to plan
for the future without it. She and Dale fully
expected to come back and live in Tower House,
for that was what they had named it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We named it that,” Irene said. “Dale
and I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It sounds romantic,” Judy answered.
“May I come and visit?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>“You certainly may. And you must come for
the celebration.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean the housewarming as soon as
you and your father have Tower House
fixed up?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Irene’s eyes danced. “Oh, no! Dale’s
supervising that. I mean celebrating the success
of his new book. I read it today. And it
will be a success,” she said softly. “Thanks
to you, Judy, it’s all true, even the happy
ending.”</p>
